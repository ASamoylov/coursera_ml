Is this just a meaningless administrative shuffle, or does this bode ill for SEI?  In my opinion, this seems like a Bad Thing, at least on the surface. Griffin seemed to be someone who was actually interested in getting things done, and who was willing to look an innovative approaches to getting things done faster, better, and cheaper.  It's unclear to me whether he will be able to do this at his new position.  Does anyone know what his new duties will be? -- _______________________________________________________________________________  Brian Yamauchi			Case Western Reserve University yamauchi@alpha.ces.cwru.edu	Department of Computer Engineering and Science _______________________________________________________________________________  "

soc.religion.christian	" From: davem@bnr.ca (Dave Mielke) Subject: Does God love you? Organization: Bell Northern Research, Ottawa, Canada Lines: 416  I have come across what I consider to be an excellent tract. It is a bit lengthy for a posting, but I thought I'd share it with all of you anyway. Feel free to pass it along to anyone whom you feel might benefit from what it says. May God richly bless those who read it.  =======================================================================  D O E S  G O D  L O V E  Y O U ?   Q. What  kind  of  question  is that?   Anyone who can read sees signs, tracts, books, and bumper stickers that say, ""God Loves You.""  Isn't that true?  A. It  is  true that God offers His love to the whole world, as we read in one of the most quoted verses in the Bible:  For  God  so  loved  the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should  not  perish,  but have everlasting life.                               John 3:16  However, God's love is qualified.  The Bible says:  The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD:  but he loveth him that followeth after righteousness.   Proverbs 15:9  For  the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.                            Psalm 1:6   Q. But  I am not wicked.  I am a decent, moral person.  Surely the good I have done in my life far outweighs whatever bad I have done.   How can these verses apply to me?  A. By  God's  standard  of  righteousness even the most moral person is looked upon by God as a desperate sinner on his way to  Hell.    The Bible teaches that no one is good enough in himself to go to Heaven. On  the  contrary,  we  are all sinners and we are all guilty before God.  As it is written, There is none righteous, no, not one:  There is  none  that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God.                                            Romans 3:10-11  The  heart  is  deceitful  above  all  things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?                         Jeremiah 17:9   Q. If I am such a wicked person in God's sight, what will God do to me?  A. The  Bible  teaches that at the end of the world all the wicked will come under eternal punishment in a place called Hell.  For  a  fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest hell, and shall consume the earth  with  her  increase, and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.  I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon them.  They shall  be  burnt  with hunger, and devoured with burning heat, and  with  bitter  destruction:  I will also send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust. Deuteronomy 32:22-24   Q. Oh,  come  on now!   Hell is not real, is it?  Surely things are not that bad.  A. Indeed,  Hell is very real, and things are that bad for the individ- ual who does not know the Lord Jesus Christ as Savior.    The  Bible makes  many  references  to Hell, indicating that it is both eternal and consists of perpetual suffering.  And  whosoever  was  not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire.                   Revelation 20:15  So  shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among  the  just,  And  shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.                            Matthew 13:49-50  ...    when  the Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, In flaming fire taking  vengeance  on  them that  know  not  God, and that obey not the gospel of our Lord Jesus   Christ:    Who  shall  be  punished  with  everlasting destruction  from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power;                            2 Thessalonians 1:7-9   Q. That is terrible!  Why would God create a Hell?  A. Hell  is  terrible,  and  it  exists  because  God created man to be accountable to God for his actions.  God's perfect  justice  demands payment for sin.  For the wages of sin is death;                     Romans 6:23  For  we  must  all  appear before the judgment seat of Christ; that every one may  receive  the  things  done  in  his  body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad. 2 Corinthians 5:10  But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak, they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment. Matthew 12:36   Q. Does that mean that at the end of the world everyone will be brought to life again to be judged and then to be sent to Hell?  A. Indeed  it  does;  that  is,  unless  we  can find someone to be our substitute in bearing the punishment of eternal  damnation  for  our sins.    That  someone  is  God  Himself, who came to earth as Jesus Christ to bear the wrath of God for all who believe in Him.  All  we  like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity  of us all.                                            Isaiah 53:6  But  he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace  was  upon  him; and with his stripes we are healed.                Isaiah 53:5  For  I  delivered  unto  you  first  of  all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according  to  the scriptures; And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:    1 Corinthians 15:3-4  For  he  hath made him to be sin for us, who knew no sin; that we might be made the righteousness of God in him. 2 Corinthians 5:21   Q. Are  you  saying that if I trust in Christ as my substitute, Who was already punished for my sins, then I will not have  to  worry  about Hell anymore?  A. Yes, this is so!  If I have believed in Christ as my Savior, then it is  as  if  I  have already stood before the Judgment Throne of God. Christ as my substitute has already paid for my sins.  He  that  believeth  on  the Son hath everlasting life: and he that believeth not the Son shall not see life; but  the  wrath of God abideth on him.                               John 3:36   Q. But  what  does it mean to believe on Him?  If I agree with all that the Bible says about Christ as Savior, then am I saved from going to Hell?  A. Believing  on  Christ  means  a  whole lot more than agreeing in our minds with the truths of the Bible.  It means that we hang our whole lives  on Him.   It means that we entrust every part of our lives to the  truths  of the Bible.  It means that we turn away from our sins and serve Christ as our Lord.  No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one, and  love  the  other;  or  else  he will hold to the one, and despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon. Matthew 6:24  Repent  ye  therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from  the presence of the Lord;                                Acts 3:19   Q. Are  you  saying  that  there  is no other way to escape Hell except through Jesus?   What about all the other  religions?    Will  their followers also go to Hell?  A. Yes, indeed.  They cannot escape the fact that God holds us account- able  for  our  sins.   God demands that we pay for our sins.  Other religions  cannot  provide  a  substitute  to bear the sins of their followers.  Christ is the only one who is able to bear our guilt and save us.  Neither  is  there  salvation  in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby  we  must  be saved.                                               Acts 4:12  Jesus said:  I  am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.                                   John 14:6  If  we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. 1 John 1:9   Q. Now I am desperate.  I do not want to go to Hell.  What can I do?  A. You  must  remember  that God is the only one who can help you.  You must throw yourself altogether on the mercies of God.   As  you  see your hopeless condition as a sinner, cry out to God to save you.  And the publican, standing afar off, would not lift up so much as  his  eyes  unto heaven, but smote upon his breast, saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.                     Luke 18:13  ...  Sirs, what must I do to be saved?  And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shalt be saved, ... Acts 16:30-31   Q. But how can I believe on Christ if I know so little about Him?  A. Wonderfully,  God  not  only saves us through the Lord Jesus, but He also gives us the faith to believe on Him.  You can pray to God that He will give you faith in Jesus Christ as your Savior.  For  by  grace  are  ye  saved  through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God:               Ephesians 2:8  God works particularly through the Bible to give us that faith.  So, if  you  really  mean  business  with  God about your salvation, you should  use  every opportunity to hear and study the Bible, which is the only Word of God. In  this  brochure,  all  verses  from the Bible are within indented paragraphs.  Give heed to them with all your heart.  So  then  faith  cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.                                              Romans 10:17   Q. But does this mean that I have to surrender everything to God?  A. Yes.    God wants us to come to Him in total humility, acknowledging our sinfulness and our helplessness, trusting totally in Him.  The  sacrifices  of  God  are  a broken spirit: a broken and a contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.      Psalm 51:17  Because  we  are sinners we love our sins.  Therefore, we must begin to pray to God for an intense  hatred  of  our  sins.    And  if  we sincerely desire salvation, we will also begin to turn from our sins as  God  strengthens  us.    We know that our sins are sending us to Hell.  Unto  you  first God, having raised up his Son Jesus, sent him to bless you, in turning  away  every  one  of  you  from  his iniquities.                                          Acts 3:26   Q. Doesn't  the  Bible teach that I must attend church regularly and be baptized?  Will these save me?  A. If  possible,  we should do these things, but they will not save us. No work of any kind can secure our salvation.   Salvation  is  God's sovereign gift of grace given according to His mercy and good pleas- ure.  Salvation is  Not of works, lest any man should boast.         Ephesians 2:9   Q. What else will happen at the end of the world?  A. Those  who have trusted in Jesus as their Savior will be transformed into their glorious eternal bodies and will be with Christ  forever- more.  For  the  Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the  trump  of  God: and  the  dead  in Christ shall rise first:  Then we which are alive  and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds,  to meet the Lord in the air:  and so shall we ever be with the Lord.                         1 Thessalonians 4:16-17   Q. What will happen to the earth at that time?  A. God  will destroy the entire universe by fire and create new heavens and a new earth where Christ will reign with His believers  forever- more.  But  the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise,  and the  elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and the   works  that  are  therein  shall  be  burned  up.    ... Nevertheless  we,  according  to  his  promise,  look  for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness. 2 Peter 3:10,13   Q. Does  the  Bible  give us any idea of when the end of the earth will come?  A. Yes!    The end will come when Christ has saved all whom He plans to save.  And  this  gospel  of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations; and then shall  the  end come.                                            Matthew 24:14   Q. Can we know how close to the end of the world we might be?  A. Yes!   God gives much information in the Bible concerning the timing of the history of the world and tells us that while the Day  of  the Lord  will come as a thief in the night for the unsaved, it will not come  as  a  thief for the believers.  There is much evidence in the Bible  that  the  end  of  the world and the return of Christ may be very, very close.* All the time clues in the Bible point to this.  For  when  they  shall  say,  Peace  and  safety;  then sudden destruction cometh upon them, as travail  upon  a  woman  with child; and they shall not escape.          1 Thessalonians 5:3  Surely  the  Lord  GOD  will  do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets.                Amos 3:7   Q. But that means Judgment Day is almost here.  A. Yes,  it  does.    God  warned  ancient Nineveh that He was going to destroy that great city and He gave them forty days warning.  And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he cried,  and  said,  Yet  forty  days,  and  Nineveh  shall  be overthrown.                                          Jonah 3:4   Q. What did the people of Nineveh do?  A. From  the  king on down they humbled themselves before God, repented of their sins, and cried to God for mercy.  But  let  man  and  beast  be  covered with sackcloth, and cry mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his  evil way,  and  from  the violence that is in their hands.  Who can tell  if  God  will  turn  and  repent, and turn away from his fierce anger, that we perish not?                  Jonah 3:8-9   Q. Did God hear their prayers?  A. Yes.  God saved a great many people of Nineveh.   Q. Can  I still cry to God for mercy so that I will not come into judg- ment?  A. Yes.   There is still time to become saved even though that time has become very short.  How  shall  we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed unto us by them that heard him;                    Hebrews 2:3  In  God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength, and my refuge, is in God.   Trust in  him  at  all  times;  ye people,  pour  out  your heart before him: God is a refuge for us.                                               Psalm 62:7-8     A R E  Y O U  R E A D Y  T O  M E E T  G O D ?    A  book  entitled  1994?,  written by Harold Camping, presents Biblical information that we may be very near the end of time.  For  information on  how to obtain a copy or to receive a free program guide and list of radio  stations on which you can hear our Gospel programs, please write to Family Radio, Oakland, California, 94621 (The United States of Amer- ica), or call 1-800-543-1495.  ----------------------------------------   The  foregoing  is a copy of the ""Does God Love You?"" tract printed by, and available free of charge from, Family Radio.   A  number  of  minor changes  have  been  made to its layout to facilitate computer printing and  distribution.  The only change to the text itself is the paragraph which  describes  the  way in which Biblical passages appear within the text.    In  the  original  tract they appear in italic lettering; they appear here as indented paragraphs.   I have read Mr. Camping's book, compared it with what the Bible actual- ly  says, find it to be the most credible research with respect to what the  future holds that I have ever come across, and agree with him that there  is just too much data to ignore.  While none of us is guaranteed one  more  second  of  life, and while we, therefore, should take these matters  very seriously regardless of when Christ will actually return, it  would appear that our natural tendency to postpone caring about our eternal  destiny  until we feel that our death is imminent is even more senseless  now  because,  in  all  likelihood, the law of averages with respect  to life expectancy no longer applies.  If you wish to obtain a copy  of  this book so that you can check out these facts for yourself, you may find the following information helpful:  title:       1994? author:      Harold Camping publisher:   Vantage Press distributor: Baker and Taylor ISBN:        0-533-10368-1   I  have  chosen  to share this tract with you because I whole-heartedly agree with everything it declares and feel that now, perhaps more  than ever  before,  this information must be made known.  To paraphrase Acts 20:27,  it  does not shun to declare unto us all the counsel of God.  I am  always  willing  to  discuss  the  eternal truths of the Bible with anyone who is interested as I believe them to be the only issues of any real  importance since we will spend, comparatively speaking, so little time  on this side of the grave and so much on the other.

soc.religion.christian	" From: jayne@mmalt.guild.org (Jayne Kulikauskas) Subject: What's in a name?: the sequel Organization: Kulikauskas home Lines: 57  I've been thinking about the idea that was raised (by Michael Covington, I think) that words mean what we think they mean, regardless of etymology.  I've been reflecting on what certain words meant in my childhood and tracing how this shaped some of my attitudes.  I grew up in a home where Christ was a bad word.  People who were very angry said it.  The word Christian meant someone who was not a Jew.  It carried connotations of otherness, of threat, of enemy.  It took some time to figure out that there was a connection between `Christ' and `Christian'.  When I accepted Jesus, I expected to be disowned.  To become a Christian meant to join the enemy.  I knew others would consider me a traitor.  At some level, I agreed, but was still prepared to pay this price.  Like Esau, I sold my birthright.  However, I made a better bargain.  He only got some stew, but I got the incomparable riches of knowing Christ.  As it turned out, my parents did not disown me.  I found out later that they were hoping it was a phase that I would grow out of.  By the time they had decided it wasn't a phase, they were sort of used to it.  They didn't disown me but they didn't completely accept the situation either. For example, they didn't come to my wedding because it was in a church. When I visited my grandmother in the hospital a few days before her death, she said to me, ""As far as I'm concerned, you still are a Jew."" What she meant was that she loved me and forgave me.  But I am not a Jew.  I am a Christian.  (I'll concede, one that likes chicken soup with matzoh balls.:-))  I do not keep kosher.  I do not celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.  My sons are not circumcised.  But these things are true of some people who do consider themselves Jews.  It is not these rules that make people Jews; it is the heritage from the past.  I gave up the past.  This is why I find it hard to relate to Messianic Jews.  Their experience is unlike mine.  They still consider themselves Jews while following Jesus.  Some would even say that I *must* do so, too.  I am at a stage of my life now where I would like to have a heritage. It was not something I valued very much when I gave it.  But I did have a sense that I was giving it for God.  It may have been a small sacrifice.  It may have been an unnecessary sacrifice.  But I gave it and do not want to ask for it back.  And while I don't have the heritage I was born with, I do have another. I am an outcast from the house of Israel, but I am a member of the Church.  One of the things I like about being a Catholic Christian is that it is rich in tradition.  It gives me a feeling of, once again, being rooted in the past.  This is probably one of the reasons why I don't like it when people mess around with Christian traditions (for example, changing the name of Easter).

As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to ""try something new"" than it is to refuse to allow it.  At our parish on Holy Thursday, instead of the priests washing feet (""Who wants to get around people's feet,"" according to one of our priests) the congregation was ""invited"" to come up and help wash one another's hands.  The symbolism of this action distressed me, and again I refused to participate.  I thought that if we were to have to come up with rubrics for this liturgical action (i.e. ""Body of Christ"" -- ""Amen"" for receiving Communion), that they could be ""I am not responsible for the blood of this man.""  Also for part of the Eucharistic Prayer (""Blessed are You, God of all creation..."") was substituted some text read by a lay couple.  The priest certainly should not have given this part of the Mass over to others, and I was so disturbed that I declined to receive Communion that night (we aren't required to anyway -- I instead offered up prayers for our priests and parish).  >So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass >going down?

The quality of the Mass has not changed.  Again, if it were to be celebrated according to the rubrics set down by the Church, it would still be ""liturgically"" beautiful.  The problem comes about from people trying to be ""creative"" who are not.  I think the answer to your question on participation could be that given by Father Peter Stravinskas in answer to the question posed by the title of Thomas Day's _Why Catholics Can't Sing_.  ""They don't want to"" because of all this nonsense.  By the way, for any non-Catholics reading this, the problem does not reflect bad liturgy by the Catholic Church, but by those who are disobedient to the Church in changing it on their own ""authority.""  -	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	-	- Steve Creps, Indiana University creps@lateran.ucs.indiana.edu "

soc.religion.christian	" From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler) Subject: The Nicene Creed (was Re: MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY) Organization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA Lines: 152  Michael Bushnell writes;  >The so-called Creed of Athanasius, however, has always been a Western >creed, and has always had the filioque.  The Orthodox have said that >they accept all that it says, with the exception of the filioque, but >it is not ""in use.""  Which is exactly what I pointed out.  (Though I was wrong about your use of the Creed, the 1913 Catholic Encylcopedia in which I read about it said the Orthodox do use the Creed minus the filioque.  Apparently that has changed.)  The Athanasian Creed has always had the Filioque, the Nicene - Constantinopolitan did not. Of course the Orthodox did not delete the Filioque from the Nicene Creed (it wasn't there to begin with), but they certainly did from the Athanasian Creed, which did have it from the beginning. I might point out that the whole problem started over the difference in ways of explaining the generation of the Blessed Trinity, the East emphasizing the idea of the Holy Spirit proceeding from the Father through the Son, and the West using proceeding from the Father and the Son.  In fact, some, such as Tertullian, used both formulations (see below)  ""Following, therefore, the form of these examples, I profess that I do call God and His Word, - the Father and and His Son, - two.  For the root and the stem are two things, but conjoined; the fountain and the river are two kinds, but indivisible; the sun and the ray are two forms, but coherent ones.  Anything which proceeds from another must necessarily be a second to that from which it proceeds; but it is not on that account separated from it.  Where there is second, however, there are two; and where ther is third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, is third from God and the Son, just as the third from the root is the fruit of the stem, and third from the fountain is the stream from the river, and thrid from the sun is the apex of the ray."" -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 8, 5 (about 213 AD)  and  ""I believe that the Spirit proceeds not otherwise than from the Father through the Son"" -Tertullian, Against Praxeas, 4, 1 (about 213 AD)  And as St. Thomas showed in his Summa Theologica Part 1, Question 36, Articles 2 and 3, there is no contradiction between the two methods of generation, and in fact, the two methods of reckoning the procession emphasize what St. Augustine, among others taught, that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, but He proceeds from the Father in a more preeminent way.  ""For whatever the Son has, He has from the Father, certainly He has it from the Father that the Holy Spirit proceeds from Him ... For the Father alone is not from another, for which reason He alone is called unbegotten, not, indeed, in the Scriptures, but in the practice of theologians, and of those who employ such terms as they are able in a matter so great.  The Son, however, is born of the Father; and the Holy Spirit proceeds principally from the Father, and since the Father gives to the Son all that He has without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit proceeds jointly from both Father and Son.  He would be called Son of the Father and of the Son if, which is abhorent to everyone of sound mind, they had both begotten Him.  The Spirit was not begotten by each, however, but proceeds from each and both."" -St. Augustine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)  So, in a sense, all of the formulations are correct (to the West at least), because the Holy Spirit proceeds from both Father and Son, but in proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that procession is the procession from the Father, so the Holy Spirit is proceeding from the Father through the Son, but as all that the Son has is from the Father, the Holy Spirit can be said to proceed from the Father, without any mention of the Son being necessary. In any case, I am happy to know that I follow in the beliefs of Pope St. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ruspe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St. Damsus I, St. Augustine of Hippo, St. Epiphanius of Salamis, St. Ambrose of Milan, St. Hilary of Poitiers, Tertullian, and others among the Fathers, who all have very quotable quotes supporting the Catholic position, which I enunciated above. As for the issue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I will point out that the Holy Fathers of Ephesus and Chalcedon both spoke of the Creed of Nicea in their statement forbidding anyone ""to produce, write, or compose a confession of faith other than the one defined by the Fathers of Nicea.""  That Creed is a different Creed than that of Constantinople, which is commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of course in that they were condemning the adoption of the Constantinopolitan Creed, which is but an enlargement upon the Creed of Nicea, but that they were condemning the impious opinions of Nestorious, who had adopted a radically different Creed from the one used by the Church, which among other things denied the procession of the Holy Spirit form the Son.  Thus, the additions of the Constantinopolitan Creed were not thought to be in violation of this, and as the Council Chalcedon also affirmed the doctrine of the procession of the Holy Spirit from the Son, which Nestorius denied, they could hardly have been against explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they themselves approved of previous additions to it.  And if the further explanations of the Creed made in Constantinople were not denigrating of the work done by the Holy Fathers of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follows that the Council of Toledo was fully able to add what was not disputed by the faithful to the Creed so as to combat the impieties of the Arians in Spain, because the filioque was not in dispute in the Church until many years later under Photius and others.  And that the filioque was not disputed, I provide more quotes below.  ""Since the Holy Spirit when he is in us effects our being conformed to God, and he actually proceeds from the Father and Son, it is abundantly clear that He is of the divine essence, in it in essence and proceeding from it."" -St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Treasury of the Holy and Consubstantial Trinity, Thesis 34, (423-425 AD)  ""The Holy Spirit is not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he is the Spirit of the Father and the Son.  For it is written: `If anyone loves the world, the Spirit of the Father is not in him'; and again it is written: `If anyone, however, does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is none of His.'  When the Father and the Son are named in this way, the Holy Spirit is understood, of whom the Son himself says in the Gospel, that the Holy Spirit `proceeds from the Father,' and that `He shall receive of mine and shall announce it to you.'"" -Pope St. Damasus I, The Decree of Damasus, 1 (382 AD)  ""The only-begotten Holy Spirit has neither the name of the Son nor the appelation of Father, but is called Holy Spirit, and is not foreign to the Father.  For the Only-begotten Himself calls Him: `the Spirit of the Father,' and says of Him the `He proceeds from the Father,' and `will receive of mine,' so that He is reckoned as not being foreign to the Son, but is of their same substance, of the same Godhead; He is Spirit divine, ... of God, and He is God.  For he is Spirit of God, Spirit of the Father, and Spirit of the Son, not by some kind of synthesis, like soul and body in us, but in the midst of Father and Son of the Father and of the Son, a third by appelation.... ""The Father always existed and the Son always existed, and the Spirit breathes from the Father and the Son; and neither is the Son created nor is the Spirit created."" -St. Epiphanius of Salamis (which is on Cyprus), The Man Well-Anchored, 8 and 75 (374 AD)  ""Concerning the Holy Spirit, I ought not to remain silent, nor yet is it necessary to speak.  Still, on account of those who do not know Him, it is not possible for me to be silent.  However it is necessary to speak of Him who must be acknowledged, who is from the Father and the Son, His Sources."" -St. Hilary of Poitiers, The Trintiy, 2, 29 (356 to 359 AD)  Thus, as I have pointed out before, Gaul, Spain, Italy, Africa, Egypt, Palastine, and the lands of the Greeks, all of Christnedom at that time, all have Fathers who can be cited to show that they confess the doctrine expressed by the filioque.  I suggest to those of the Orthodox Church that they come up with some of the Fathers, besides St. John of Damascus who all will admit denied the filioque, to support their views.  It is not enough to bring up the ""proceeds from the Father"" line of the Creed or the Gospel of John, for that says what we believe also.  But it does not say the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Son, only that He does proceed from the Father.  Andy Byler "

I believe it was a tragic mistake.  God's will can never be accomplished through the disbelief of man.  Jesus came to this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He desperately wanted the Jewish people to accept him as the Messiah.  If the crucification was the will of God how could Jesus pray that this cup pass from him.  Was this out of weakness.  NEVER.  Many men and women have given their lives for their country or other noble causes. Is Jesus less than these.  No he is not.  He knew the crucification was NOT the will of GOD.  God's will was that the Jewish people accept Jesus as the Messiah and that the kingdom of Heaven be established on the earth with Jesus as it's head. (Just like the Jewish people expected). If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what kind of world we would live in today.  It would be a very different world.  And that is eactly what GOD wanted.  Men and women of that age could have been saved by following the living Messiah while he was on the earth.  Jesus could have established a sinless lineage that would have continued his reign after his ascension to the spiritual world to live with GOD.  Now the kingdom of heaven on the earth will have to wait for Christ's return.  But when he returns will he be recognized and will he find faith on this earth.  Isn't it about time for his return.  It's been almost 2000 years.

I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded ""impact"" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.

Through this I became extremely enamoured of flying, have become involved in the sport of gliding, and have a great interest in military aviation hardware as the very best a 'real' flyer could ask for. My favourite computer games are the accurate simulations of military aircraft, both past and present.  I became a Christian about 10 years ago, and at the time rejected all military activity as immoral. For me, all war was in complete opposition to God's commandments to love one another, especially one's enemies.  During the war in Iraq, I found myself with great excitement listening to the reports of the effectiveness of the the attacks using the aviation technology I so admire - The F117A 'Stealh' bomber, the F14, F15 and F16 strike aircraft, etc. After the war concluded I began to really enjoy simulations based around this conflict - Great to go and bomb Saddam's bio-weapons plants in an F117A on my computer, or shoot down some of his Mig's in an F16. The simulation of the death of people was a wonderful game. I imagine the real pilots view the real thing in much the same way. One only has to look at the language used to see that the personal impact of war is ignored: A building containing people, or an aircraft flown by a pilot is simply a 'target'. Dead civilians are 'collateral damage'. These euphanisms are a way of removing the reality of war from the people whose support are necessary for the continued waging of war - One only has to look at Vietnam to see how important public opinion is.  Now we see troops sponsored by the United Nations entering Somalia, and the prospect of military intervention in the Muslim/Croat/Serb conflict in the former Yugoslavia. My revulsion in particular to the siege of Sarajevo, and in the last few days of (sorry 'bout spelling) Sebrenitsa, has caused me to rethink where I stand on 'justifiable' war.  I will list several wars in the last 50 years I can look at each, and say - Yes this may have been justifible, this may not. These are simply my gut reactions to each - In many cases with the benefit of the impartiality history brings. Let me go through a few and state some of my reasons for my reaction - I am not a historian, so excuse any historical blunders, I am working from popular history as it is known in New Zealand.  1. The Second World War - Murder of Jews - Hitler had to be stopped. - Massive civilian casualties on both sides - Dresden, Hiroshima/Nagasaki - Probably justifiable.  2. Korean war - Political expansionism by North Korea, basically communism vs. capitalism. - Probably not justifiable.  3. Vietnam - As above, worsened by US involvement.  4. Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia. - Genocide by Khmer Rouge. - Probably justifiable.  5. Iraq (Desert Storm) - Political expansionism, threat to world oil supply - Other factors such as genocide. - Not sure, but probably justifiable  6. A future involvement in Bosnia - Genocide - so called 'Ethnic Cleansing' - Emotive - much TV coverage of atrocities and civilian casualties. - Probably justifiable  7. Possible future use of nuclear weapons - tactical or strategic, somewhere in the world by the US in response to someone else - e.g. Libya or Israel. - My feelings in this are simple - Nuclear war/weapons are abhorrent - I love the New Zealand government's stand on banning all nuclear armed or powered warships from NZ port. - Never justifiable.  These are my own views, I have looked at scripture, and I am confused. I would appreciate others view, particularly those based on scripture. I *don't* want a - Naaahh, yer wrong - I think answers 8-).

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution, crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.  Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?  Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?  Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population (within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed) (also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...) As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start to see for example the Andromeda's bursters. The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution (but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence isotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-) If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect) and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.  If we know anything about physics at that level, the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.  The situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]  my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering hyperspace :-)  but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

There has been a lot of discussion, but so far nobody seems to have hit on exactly what the criticism of ""arrogance"" is aimed at.  The arrogance being attacked is that we ""think we are the only ones who know what the absolutes are"".  In short, many evangelicals claim that they are infallible on the matter of religious texts.  In particular, the problem is one of epistemology.  As a shorthand, you can think of epistemology as ""how do you know?""  That question, it turns out, is a very troubling one.  The problem with `absolute certainty' is that, at the bottom, at least some of the thinking goes on inside your own head.  Unless you can be certain that everything which happens in your head is infallible, the reasoning you did to discover a source of truth is in question.  And that means you do NOT have absolute justification for your source of authority -- which means you do NOT have absolute certainty.   Let's take the specific example of Biblical Inerrancy, and a fictional Inerrantist named Zeke.  (The following arguments applies to the idea of Papal Infallibility, too.)  Zeke has, we presume, spent some time studying the Bible, and history, and several other topics.  He has concluded, based on all these studies (and possibly some religious experiences) that the Bible is a source of Absolute Truth.  He may be correct; but even if he is, he cannot be certain that he is correct. His conclusion depends on how well he studied history -- he may have made mistakes, and the references he used may have contained mistakes.  His conclusion depends on how well he studied the Bible -- he may have made mistakes.  His conclusion depends on his own reasoning -- and he may have made mistakes.  (Noticing a common thread yet?  8-)  Everything about his study of the world that he did -- everything that happened in his own head -- is limited by his own thinking.  No matter what he does to try and cover his mistakes, he can never be certain of his own infallibility.  As long as ANY PART of the belief is based on his own reasoning, that belief cannot be considered ""absolutely certain"".  Zeke believes that he has found a source of absolute truth -- but that belief is only as good as the quality of the search he made for it.  Unless he can say that his own reasoning is flawless, his conclusions are in doubt.  Any belief that you hold about absolute sources of truth depends in part on your own thinking -- there is no way out of the loop.  Only an infallible thinker can have absolute certainty in all his beliefs.   This is easy to demonstrate.  Let's go back to our shorthand method of doing epistemology: ""how do you know?""  Imagine a hypothetical discussion:  A: The Bible is a source of absolute truth.  B: How do you know?  A: I studied history and the Bible and religious writings and church teachings and came to this conclusion.  B: How do you know you studied history correctly?  A: Well, I double-checked everything.  B: How do you know you double-checked correctly?  A: Well, I compared my answers with some smart people and we agreed.  B: Just because some smart guy believes something that doesn't mean it is true.  How do you know THEY studied it correctly?  A: ...  And, as you see, B will eventually get A to the point where he has to say ""I can't prove that there are no mistakes"" -- and as long as you may have made a mistake, then you cannot be ABSOLUTELY certain.  There is no way out of the loop.   This is where the ""arrogance of Christians"" arises: many people believe that their own personal research can give them absolute certainty about the doctrines of Christianity -- they are implicitly claiming that they are infallible, and that there is no possibility of mistake.  Claiming that you CANNOT have made a mistake, and that your thinking has led you to a flawless conclusion, is pretty arrogant.  *  People who want to see this argument explained in great detail should try to find _The Infallibility of the Church_, by George Salmon.  He is attacking the idea that the Pope can be knowably infallible (and he does so very well), but the general argument applies equally well to the idea that the Bible is knowably Inerrant.

The peakups were successful. The observations were executed as scheduled, and no problems were reported.  o Observations were made using the High Speed Photometer of the Planet Uranus during an occultation by a faint star in Capricornus. These observations will help in our understanding of the planet's atmospheric radiative and dynamical processes.

Does He grade on a curve, does He cheat? That is interesting. Not to mention thought provoking. My own concept is that He is a Father and we are His children. In that He loves us, with a love that we can never understand until we are with Him. The Bible says that He looks on the heart as the final measure. From that perspective, in a grading context, the heart is the final test. Specifically, most Christians would agree that there is only one Heaven and one Hell. From that perspective, it is Heaven or Hell. You either go to one or the other. The ""grading"" on a pass/fail basis is done by God the Father with intervention by Jesus the Son. Not by others. For only God sees the heart. The Bible says of the heart, ""...who can know it."" I would say there has always been, and always be, an unchanging method. That is what makes a relationship with Christ so secure. In an uncertain and ever changing landscape He is always the same. Yesterday, today and tomorrow. Concerning whether or not our childhoods are considerd as part of the test, my own conviction is no. Were that the case I certainly wouldn't be going to Heaven. The Bible speaks very plainly about the love and care Jesus had for and about children. The reality is that we are all children. Some of us just have bigger bodies and grey hair. But the Father, our Father is always there. Like most Fathers He wants only the best for His own. There maybe decipline, but there is more love. It's sometimes looks like Christianity is a test, to see who makes it and who doesn't. Those who do pass=Heaven, and those who don't go to the other place. But it is really much more than that... There are few experts. Most of us are just travelers looking for the light and the way Home. Praying that we can bring others with us. "

Jewish history as recorded in the Old Testament and as shown by archaeology are the same.  Kings, revivals, Temples, and all.  The Torah, as far as I know, is the five books of Moses.  Then come the Prophets (all the Prophets, plus Joshua, Judges, 1&2 Samuel, 1&2 Kings) and the Writings (Psalms, Proverbs, Lamentations, Ruth, Esther, Ezra, Nehemiah, Ecclesiates, Song of Songs, 1&2 Chronicles, Job).  And the veracity of Isaiah, which you quoted to your Moslem friend is quite well known.  A complete manuscript exists that dates back to past 200 BC, and is kept in a Museum in Israel.  It was found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, which greatly enhanced our knowledge of the veracity of the Old Testament, as they date back to around the time of Christ, whereas before, the oldest complete manuscript in Hebrew was from around 900 AD.  Your Moslem friend is sorely mistaken, but understandably so.  If Jesus was crucified, and atoned for our sins, he must have been God, for only the death of God could atone for the sins of all humanity.  And as Isaiah predicts, the messiah will be called ""the mighty God.""  And if he was God, then he must have rose, for as St. Paul wrote, it was not possible that death could hold him.  And if Jesus rose from the dead, your Moslem friend would have little reason to be a Moslem.  Which is why he denies the authenticity of the Old Testament.  Andy Byler "

Q. How do I become an astronaut?  A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission specialist"".  If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that, the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people, but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason, many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.  Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore- seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner.  Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical, you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.  Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie. Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point, and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent. Keep your nose clean.  Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby; experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.  Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988, 43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut). If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".  Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation.  Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.     NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center Houston, Texas  Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates ==================================================================  Astronaut Candidate Program ---------------------------  The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.  Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered.  All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation program.  Space Shuttle Program Description ---------------------------------  The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew.  The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries.  The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot, and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA astronauts.  Pilot Astronaut  Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots. During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle, crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other payload operations.  Mission Specialist Astronaut  Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot, have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific experimental operations.  Astronaut Candidate Program ===========================  Basic Qualification Requirements --------------------------------  Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to submitting an application.  Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:  1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible, professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master's degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic preparation is important.  2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following specific standards:  Distant visual acuity: 20/150 or better uncorrected, correctable to 20/20, each eye.  Blood pressure: 140/90 measured in sitting position.  3. Height between 58.5 and 76 inches.  Pilot Astronaut Candidate:  1. Bachelor's degree from an accredited institution in engineering, biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible, professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of academic preparation is important.  2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight test experience highly desirable.  3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following specific standards:  Distant visual acuity: 20/50 or better uncorrected correctable to 20/20, each eye.  Blood pressure: 140/90 measured in sitting position.  4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.  Citizenship Requirements  Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of the United States.  Note on Academic Requirements  Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions -- specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor's degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering, biological science, physical science, or mathematics.  The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the sciences, are not considered qualifying: - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology, Medical Technology, etc.) - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological Psychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying). - Degrees in Nursing. - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.) - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.  Application Procedures ----------------------  Civilian  The application package may be obtained by writing to:  NASA Johnson Space Center Astronaut Selection Office ATTN: AHX Houston, TX 77058  Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is made. Applications received after that date will be retained and considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as supervisors and references may be contacted.  Active Duty Military  Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application procedures will be disseminated by each service.  Selection ---------  Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration. Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered will be notified of the outcome of the process.  Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the selection of additional candidates during a one year period following their establishment.  General Program Requirements  Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during their candidate period.  Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a specified tour of duty.  NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates. Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.  Pay and Benefits ----------------  Civilians  Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14, and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements and experience.  Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and participation in group health and life insurance plans.  Military  Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and other similar military matters.

Could it be possible that many people believe in god ""just in case""? It seems people do not want to seek the truth; they fall prey to Pascal's Wager or other poor arguments. A small minority of those who do believe reads the Bible regularly. The majority doesn't care - it believes, but doesn't know what or how.

A Christian would say that they are not ""born in the Spirit"", but this does not disturb them. Religion is not something to think about.  I'm afraid a society with a true atheist majority is an impossible dream. Religions have a strong appeal to people, nevertheless - a promise of life after death is something humans eagerly listen to.

Organization: BGSU Lines: 43  The people who post to this particular newsgroup are either too cowardly, too arrogant, or too apathetic to discuss this issue since I have yet to see any discussion grace my computer screen.  While it holds PARTICULAR interest to the African-American community, everyone has something to gain from discussing it.  As any knowledgable person should know, Christianity has been used in this country to tighten the spiritual, emotional, & mental hold slavery placed on the minds, souls & hearts of African-Americans. This was most effectively done by the display of white icons of Jesus in slave churches to encourage the godly superiority of slaveowners.  It wasn't enough that the slaveowner was your provider, but he was also your GOD, to be looked upon with unconditional love & loyalty and to be worshipped with great pride.  But how culturally & biblically accurate are these icons?  Pictures & statues of a Black Jesus have been found in European countries, as that of a Black Madonna.  But what about Biblical physical descriptions of Jesus, His hair being compared to that of wool, His feet to that of brass?  And think about the area of the world where all Biblical actions took place.  I welcome all intelligent commentary on this important topic; flamers need not reply.  Sherlette  P.S.  I expect at least THIS type of response:  ""It doesn't matter what color His skin was; His actions & what He did for mankind are what counts."" This is true; I am not questioning this.  But He walked the earth for 3 decades as a HUMAN; this part of His existence intrigues me.  And as for saying that ""it doesn't matter...""  to a member of a physically emancipated people who is still struggling for MENTAL emancipation, believe me:  IT MATTERS.  [The general attack on the members of this group seems unjustified. There has been discussion of this issue in the past.  We can't discuss everything at once, so the fact that some specific thing hasn't been discussed recently shouldn't be taken as a sign of general cowardice, arrogance or apathy.  In past discussions no one has been outraged by suggestions that Jesus could be black (and it has been suggested by a few scholars), but the concensus is that he was most likely Semitic. As you probably know, there is a tradition that portrayals of Jesus in art tends to show him as one of the people.  Thus you wouldn't be surprised to find African art showing him as black, and oriental art showing him as oriental.  There are good reasons relating to Christian devotion to think of him in such a way.  It's also good now and then to have that image challenged, and to think of Jesus as being a member of XXX, where XXX is the group you least respect.  --clh] "

So what distinguishes, for example, the >Branch Davidian ""cult"" from the Presbyterian ""church""?  Doctrinal >differences don't answer the question, IMHO, so don't use them as >an answer.   As far as I can see, one of the big differences between Davidians and Christians is in who they follow.  I have sometimes tried to put myself in the feet of one of Jesus's disciples.  Basically, they gave up a lot --- career, possibly family, and well, a whole bunch, to follow Jesus.  So what is the difference?  It is quite plain.  Jesus was good and David Koresh was not.  The problem is, I think, is that we try to legislate what is good and what is bad in terms of principles.  For instance, there are thousands of laws in the U.S. governing what is legal and what is not.  Often, it is hard to bring people to justice, because it is not possible to find a legal way to do it.  If only we could trust judges to be just, then we could tell them to administer justice fairly, and justice would be followed.  But since judges don't always get it right, we have a complicated system involving precedent and bunches of other stuff which attempt to make the imperfect (the justice of man) into something perfect.  But what I hear about the justice system in the U.S. tells me that quite the opposite is true.  There is also a problem that we tend to judge the presentation more than the material being presented.  So we might consider a ranting Christian to be bad, but an eloquent person from another religion to be good.  This goes along with the American desire to protect the Constitution at all costs, even if it allows people to do bad things.  I think that it is the message that is important.  If a man is presenting a false message, even if he is ever ever so mild mannered, then that man is performing a tremendous disservice.  I know that I am rambling here.  I guess that what I am trying to say is that we shouldn't be looking for principles that tell us why the Davidians got it wrong.  It is not wrong to follow and worship a person.  But it is important to choose the right person. It is simple.  Choose Jesus, and you got it right.  Choose anyone else, and you got it wrong.  Why?  Because Jesus is the begotten son of God, and nobody else is.  Jesus was without sin, and nobody else was.  Stephen "

Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, >this is truth and therefore absolute.  Hold it.  I said that all of scripture is true.  However, discerning exactly what Jesus, Paul and company were trying to say is not always so easy.  I don't believe that Paul was trying to say that all women should behave that way.  Rather, he was trying to say that under the circumstances at the time, the women he was speaking to would best avoid volubility and cover their heads.  This has to do with maintaining a proper witness toward others.  Remember that any number of relativistic statements can be derived from absolutes.  For instance, it is absolutely right for Christians to strive for peace.  However, this does not rule out trying to maintain world peace by resorting to violence on occasion.  (Yes, my opinion.)  >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) >Can you reconcile this?  Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal clear (at least to evangelicals).  Sometimes they are not so clear to everyone (e.g. should baptism be by full immersion or not, etc).  That is largely because sometimes, it is not explicitly spelled out whether the writers are speaking to a particular culture or to Christianity as a whole.  This is where scholarship and the study of Biblical contexts comes in.  >It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based >on your own *interpretation* is absolute.

If supernatural beings exist, it is >= as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.  I beg to disagree with the assertion that science is a collection of models. Scientific models are a game to play, and are only as good as the assumptions and measurements (if any) that go into them.  As an example, I remember when nuclear winter was the big hype in atmospheric science.  It wasn't long after Sagan's admonitions that one of our boys was adding another level of reality into his model of the nuclear winter scenario at ERL in Boulder.  He decided to assume that the atmosphere is more like a two-dimensional thing, than a one- dimensional thing.  He also assumed that it rained and that the winds blow in the real atmosphere.  On returning to Georgia Tech, he showed a transparency of atmospheric cooling rates according to the year they were generated by the models.  There was an unmistakable correlation between the age (meaning simplicity of assumptions; i.e., remoteness from reality) of each model and the degree of cooling.  Whereas Sagan's model showed an approximate 40-degree cooling episode, the next model in sophistication showed about half that, and so on until we got to our boy's model, which showed a 1-2 degree drop if the war happened in the winter and less than a 10 degree drop if it happened in the summer. He predicted that when we would include the presence of oceans, chemistry, the biosphere, and other indicators of reality in the models, we would probably see even less cooling.  Thus nuclear winter was reduced to even less than a nuclear autumn, one might say, to a nuclear fizzle.  To quote from H.S. Yoder,  The postulated models have become accepted as the reality instead of the lattice of assumptions they are. Authoritarianism dominates the field, and a very critical analysis of each argument is to be encouraged.... Skepticism of the model approach to earth problems is warranted because many key parameters have not been included.  This statement surely applies equally well to cosmogony.  Only when convincing observational evidence substantiates the modeled results may one suggest that the model may describe the reality.  Just thought I'd clear that up before things really got out of hand.  -- boundary  no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he venido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina) "

While I agree with most of Jon says (I deleted those parts, of course), I have serious reservations about this advice.  Maintaining a `just friends' level of relationship is much easier said than done.  People usually end up getting hurt.  This is especially likely to happen when they start off with feelings of attraction.  When people feel attracted those feelings can cloud their judgement. I've had the experience of going quickly from believing that I shouldn't date non-Christians to believing that dating this man would be okay to believing that premarital sex is fine when people really love each other.  When the relationship ended my beliefs immediately returned to their original state.  This is an especially extreme case because I was young and away from home and fellowship.  I don't think it would work exactly this way for most people.  However, it's important not to underestimate the power of feelings of attraction.  Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org

Status: R  Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.  Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.  In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the industry.  At times, he has claimed to ""have hardware which will blow anything else away"", while more recently he claims they have stopped manufacturing their own.  Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and possibly Canon equipment.  The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations, including a young man who will identify himself only as ""Bill"" and claims to be the ""MS-iah"".  Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work 20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of ""interpersonal computing"" which rejects traditional roles.  Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers carry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling ""I want to welcome you to the 'Next World' "".  - - -- Roland J.

The concept of a closed canon would >certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand, >an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes.  There are a lot of people running around saying ""God told me this"" and ""God told me that"" these days.  Some people really have heard God, and others heard their glands.  Mario Murrillo mentioned this in a sermon once.  He said someone told him, ""The Lord gave me a song.""  He said that it was the worst song he had ever heard.  ""I know why he gave you that song,"" Murillo said, ""He didn't want it anymore.""  But God does still speak to His people today, and the idea is contrary to the idea of a closed cannon.  Ireneaus wrote about all the gifts of the Spirit in the church of His day (2nd and 3rd century) and he was one of the first to put forth a New Testament cannon, which was almost identical to the one we have today.  He believed in a closed cannon.  Many prophets prophesied prophecies which were not recorded in the Scriptures. For example, one prophet in Kings, whose name starts with an ""M"" who prophecied that the king would lose a battle.  That is the only prophecy he gave recorded in Scripture, and we no that he had given other prophecies because the king complained before he heard the prophecy, ""He never prophesies anything good about me.""  Yet only one little paragraph of all of his lifetime of prophecies are recorded in Scripture.  There are numerous examples. Barnabas was a prophet, Acts says, before he was even sent out as an apostle.  Yet his writings are not recorded in Scripture.  Only two of Agabus prophecies are mentioned in Scripture.  He was already a prophet before he gave them.  So prophecy may be genuine and from God, but that does not make it Scripture.  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call >that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with >knowledge?  I don't know about translations of Scripture, but I am familiar with prophecies that give applications for Scripture.  There are also similar examples in the Bible.  Several times Peter interprets prophecies in a seemingly prophetic way, for example, ""And his bishoprick let another take"" concerning Judas office.  A clearer example can be found in Matthew 24.  Jesus is prophesying about what will happen before His return and He quotes a passage out of Joel about the sun being darkened and the moon turning to blood.  So Scriptural prophecy can be used in later prophecy.  Sometimes this sort of thing can cross over into being a word of knowledge, but gifts of the Spirit seem to overlap.  Words of knowledge and wisdom can overlap.  The word of knowledge and prophecy can overlap. Interpretation of tounges is very similar to prophecy.  Healings are often considered miracles.  So sometimes the distinction between gifts is a bit hazy.  Imho, it doesn't usually matter that much if we are able to label a phenomenon, as long as we recognize them as the work of the Spirit, and use them according to His leading.  Link Hudson. "

My poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses, sitting very close to Jupiter, play any role whatsoever in the problem.   Or, to put it more technically, the extra ""volume"" they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible.  Jupiter is 2E27 kg, while the Galilean satellites are around 1E23.  Also, as I said, the few references that I've looked at do not mention outgassing or breakup as important processes.

Can you reference?  However, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shias follow:  ""Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever. Never let them give their advice on any matter whatsoever, even those of everyday life. Indeed, allow them freely to give advice on anything and they will fritter away one's wealth and disobey the wishes of the owner of this wealth. We see them without religion, when, alone, they are left to their own devices; they are lacking in both pity and virtue when their carnal desires are at stake. It is easy to enjoy them, but they cause great anxiety. The most virtious among them are libertines. But the most corrupt are whores. Only those of them whom age has deprived of any charm are untainted by vice. They have three qualities particular to miscreants; they complain of being oppressed, whereas it is they who oppress; they make oaths, whereas they are lying; they pretend to refuse men's solicitations, whereas they desire them most ardently. Let us beg the help of God to emerge victorious from their evil deeds. And preserve us in any case from their good ones.""  (Quote from Mas'ud al-Qanawi, ref. A. Bouhdiba, Sexuality in Islam, p. 118).  I wouldn't consider this quote as being exemplary of the Islamic (TM) viewpoint though.  For all we know, the prophet's cousin and the Fourth Khalif Hazret-i Ali may have said this after a frustrating night with a woman.  Selim Guncer  -- Selim E.

There are no other alternatives.  And if we accept one or the other of those two premises, then again there are two alternatives, either creation was random, or was according to some plan. If it was random, I am unable to accept that the complex nature of our world with interrelated interdependent organisms and creatures could exist as they do.  Therefore I am left with creation under the control of an intelligence capable of devising such a scheme.  I call that intelligence God. I also prefer the ""Creatio ex nihilo"" rather than from chaos, as it is cleaner. There is obviously no way to prove either or neither.  We are and we must have come from somewhere.

soc.religion.christian	" From: Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca (Desiree Bradley) Subject: Doing the work of God??!!) Organization: MIND LINK! - British Columbia, Canada Lines: 33  As our local.religion.christian BBS group seems moribund, I'm posting here.  On one of the Sundays just before Easter I went to church.  The sermon was based on a story in the Book of Joshua.  (The one about Joshua sending out spies to the land he was planning to take)  What I particularly remember, because of having heard part of a CBC radio documentary on Bosnia, was that the Rahab (the woman who sheltered the spies) said that the people were ""melting in fear.""  What with having heard that CBC radio documentary and knowing that the Muslims in Bosnia were losing the war, I felt uncomfortable.  After all, the Serbs are driving non-Christians out.  On the other hand, ministers do say that the Bible is opposed to the values held by our secular society.  Anyhow members of that church are involved in out-of-country missionary work.  Also, the pastor has talked of spiritual warfare and of bringing Christ to the nonreligious people of our area.  The next Sunday, the sermon was about Joshua 6 (where the Israelites take Jericho and then proceed to massacre everybody there --- except for Rahab, who had sheltered the spies).  With those reports about Bosnia in my mind, I felt uncomfortable about the minister saying that the massacre (the one in Joshua) was right.  But what really bothered me was that, if I was going to try taking Christianity seriously, I shouldn't be so troubled about the reports of ""ethnic cleansing"" in Bosnia.  Certainly, my sympathies shouldn't be with the Moslims. Considering that the Bosnian Muslims are descendants of Christians who, under Turkish rule, converted to Islam could the Serbs be doing God's work?  [The example of God's people setting out on bloody wars of conquest has always been troubling in discussions here.  I personally question whether they were right even at the time.  But those who believe they were consider that the wars were justified only because they were specifically commanded by God.  Somehow I don't see the Serbs behaving like a group that is led by God in this matter.  --clh] "

I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He also noted that the software people were starting to feel management pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)  Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure. As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.  As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software. Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care. (None of the experimenters could afford it.) -- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry 
soc.religion.christian	" From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler) Subject: Re: Sabbath Admissions 5of5 Organization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA Lines: 34  All of the arguments concerning the Sabbath ought to make the point pretty clear - anyone outside of the Catholic or Orthodox orAnglican or Monophysite churches ourght to worship on Saturday if they are really sola scriptura.  Otherwise, they are following a law put into effect by the Church, and only the above Chruches really recognize any power of the Chruch to do so.  Andy Byler  [You will note that nothing in the FAQ said anything about the Church establishing or changing a law.  The argument against the Sabbath is that it is part of the ceremonial law, and like the rest of the ceremonial law is not binding on Christians.  This argument is based on Paul's letters, Acts, and in a more general sense, Jesus' teachings.  Further, most people argue that Scripture shows worship occuring on Sunday, and Paul endorsing it.  I understand that these points are disputed, and do not want to go around the dispute one more time.  The point I'm making here is not that these arguments are right, but that the backing they claim is Scripture.  Accepting the principle of ""sola scriptura"" does not commit us to obeying the entire Jewish Law.  Acts 15 and Paul's letters are quite clear on that.  I think even the SDA's accept it.  The disagreement is on where the Bible would have us place the line.  By the way, Protestants do give authority to the church, in matters that are not dictated by God.  That's why churches are free to determine their own liturgies, church polity, etc.  If you accept that the Sabbath is not binding on Christians, then the day of worship falls into the category of items on which individual Christians or (since worship is by its nature a group activity) churches are free to decide.  --clh] "

Covington  I do recall Watt making a comment to this effect, though it was quite a few years back and I can't cite the specifics.  I also recall that Cecil Andrus, who was Secretary of the Interior during the Carter Administration, responded to Watt's comments by pointing out the stewardship role that God gave to man, as recorded in Genesis.  Which makes me wonder: who are the true conservatives?  It seems to me that a *conservative* should want to *conserve* things of value for long-term societal benefit.  This form of *conservation* should logically extend to the physical environment in which people live, as well as the moral environment in which they relate to one another and to God.  IMHO, Watt's stewardship status is not enhanced by the fact that he served on the board of directors for Jim Bakker's organization, during a time in which Bakker committed criminal acts which eventually landed Bakker in federal prison.

If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).  If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).  The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.  Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization.  Questions fall into three basic types:  1) Where do I find some information about space?  Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended discussion.  2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?  Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.  3) Miscellanous queries.  These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of FAQ postings.   SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE  Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet. Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?] Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent. Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth 100 posts). Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST not SPACE. Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all references.) Cut down attributed articles (leave only the points you're responding to; remove signatures and headers). Summarize! Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail or article), state your institution, etc. Don't assume the 'reply' function of mailers will work. Use absolute dates. Post in a timely way. Don't post what everyone will get on TV anyway. Some editors and window systems do character count line wrapping: keep lines under 80 characters for those using ASCII terminals (use carriage returns).

""The Popehat(tm) is actually an advanced bone spur."", reveals Gillow in his groundshaking report. Gillow, who had  secretly  studied the innermost workings of the Vatican since returning from Vietnam in a wheel chair, first approached the scientific community with his  theory in the late 1950's.  ""The  whole hat  thing, that was just a cover  up.

The whole bone transplant idea started  in  the  mid   sixties  inspired  by   doctor  Timothy  Leary transplanting deer  bone cells into small white rats."" Gillow is quick to point  out  the  assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II and the disappearance of Dr.  Leary from the public eye.  ""When it becomes time to replace the pope"", says Gillow, ""The old pope and the replacement pope are  locked  in a padded  chamber.

Please keep that in mind as you read this post - I do not wish to attack environmentalism)  A half truth is at least as dangerous as a complete lie.  A complete lie will rarely be readily accepted, while a half truth (the lie subtly hidden) is more powerfully offered by one who masquerades as an angel of light.  Satan has (for some people) loosened the grip on treating the earth as something other than God's intricate handiwork, something other than that on which the health of future generations is based.  It is being treated with respect.  You think he's going to happily leave it at that?  No.  When one error is rejected, it is his style to push people to the opposite error.  Therefore the earth is not God's intricate handiwork, not because it is rubbish, but because it is God.  Mother earth is the one you are to primarily love and serve.  I see two facets of a response to it:  1: Care for the environment.  Treat it with proper respect, both because it is God's intricate handiwork and the health of future generation, and because showing the facet of one who is disregardful of such things does not constitute what the Apostle Paul called ""becoming all things to all men so that by all possible means I might save some.""  Don't say ""Forget the environment, I've got important things to spend my time on."" - putting your foot in your mouth in this manner will destroy your credibility in expressing the things that _are_ more important.  2: Show that it is not the ultimate entity, that it is creature and not creator.

If the gospels are the least bit accurate, then there can be little doubt that Jesus belived hell was a reality.  As a teacher, what would be the wise and loving thing to do if people in your audience were headed there?  To warn them!  It would, however, be rather cruel and/or sadistic to believe that such a place exists and then remain quiet about it.  The only scenario I can envision in which dimished respect would be justified is if Jesus knew there was no such place as hell, and spoke about it anyway, just to scare people.

In Japanese, with abstract in English. This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS (experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13, 1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <---- station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also discussed.

RPN: AIAA PAPER 90-1343 Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high- power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <---- observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <---- collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years.

In International Council of Scientific Unions, Middle Atmosphere Program. Handbook for MAP, Vol. 20 5 p Publication Date: Jun. 1986 As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal division/combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement and results are discussed.

A large clear air radar with the sensitivity of an incoherent scatter radar for observing the whole equatorial atmosphere up to 1000 km altitude is now being designed in Japan. The radar will be built in Pontianak, West Kalimantan, Indonesia (0.03 deg N, 109.29 deg E). The system is a 47-MHz monostatic Doppler radar with an active phased array configuration similar to that of the MU radar in Japan, which has been in successful operation since 1983. It will have a PA product of about 3 x 10 to the 9th W sq m (P = average transmitter power, A = effective antenna aperture) with a sensitivity of approximately 10 times that of the MU radar. This system configuration enables pulse-to-pulse beam steering within 20 deg from the zenith. As is the case of the MU radar, a variety of operations will be made feasible under the supervision of the radar controller. A brief description of the system configuration is presented.

I disagree: every proposition needs a certain amount of evidence and support, before one can believe it. There are a miriad of factors for each individual. As we are all different, we quite obviously require different levels of evidence.  As one pointed out, one's history is important. While in FUSSR, one may not believe a comrade who states that he owns five pairs of blue jeans. One would need more evidence, than if one lived in the United States. The only time such a statement here would raise an eyebrow in the US, is if the individual always wear business suits, etc.  The degree of the effect upon the world, and the strength of the claim also determine the amount of evidence necessary. When determining the level of evidence one needs, it is most certainly relevent what the consequences of the proposition are.    If the consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, please explain why one would not accept: The electro-magnetic force of attraction between two charged particles is inversely proportional to the cube of their distance apart.  Remember, if the consequences of the law are not relevent, then we can not use experimental evidence as a disproof. If one of the consequences of the law is an incongruency between the law and the state of affairs, or an incongruency between this law and any other natural law, they are irrelevent when theorizing about the ""Truth"" of the law.  Given that any consequences of a proposition is irrelvent, including the consequence of self-contradiction or contradiction with the state of affiars, how are we ever able to  judge what is true or not; let alone find ""The Truth""?    By the way, what is ""Truth""? Please define before inserting it in the conversation. Please explain what ""Truth"" or ""TRUTH"" is. I do think that anything is ever known for certain. Even if there IS a ""Truth"", we could never possibly know if it were. I find the concept to be meaningless.  --   ""Satan and the Angels do not have freewill. They do what god tells them to do.

Is it appropriate for the Lord not to reveal certain things before the world (i.e., publish them widely)?  These things sacred to Himself.  He may place any pre- or post-conditions He feels are necessary.  Moreover, there are precedents in scripture where knowledge of sacred things is withheld:  1. After the Transfiguration Jesus instructed Peter, James, and John to ""tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be risen again from the dead"" (Matt. 17:9). If we were living at the time of Savior, there would be no (public) record of this event.  2. A faithful friend of Paul experiences a vision of ""paradise"" when he ""heard unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"" (2 Cor. 12:4). This person heard something which Paul can not write to the Corinthians (and us).  3. There is an incident recorded in the Book of Mormon where words uttered by ""babes"" were ""forbidden that there should not any man write them (3 Nephi 26:16, the entire text follows for those of you without access to the BOM).  3 Nephi 26:16 Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.  Some LDS scholars speculate that these words which could not be written are the sacred portions from temple we are to withhold from the world (but it could be something else).  >I >can understand why Mormons would limit temple access to only faithful >Mormons, but I have never understood the emphasis on shrouding temple >ritual in mystery.

I am not posting here as an immature flame start, but rather to express an opinion to my intended audience.  The meaning of my existence is a question I ask myself daily.  I live in fear of what will happen when I  die.  I bet some of you are licking your lips now, because you think that I'm a person on the edge of accepting jeezus.  I was raised in a religious atmosphere, and attended 13 years of religious educational institutions..  I know the bible well. So well I can recognize many passages from memory.  <<****Strong opinions start here...****>>  1) The human being is an _animal_ who has, due to his/her advanced mental facilities, developed religious as a satisfiable solution to explain the unexplainable.  (For example the ancient Greeks believed that Apollo drove his chariot across the sky each day was real.  Due to the advancement of our technology, we know this to be false.  Christianity is an infectious cult.  The reasons it flourishes are because 1) it gives people without hope or driven purpose in life a safety blanked to hide behind.  ""Oh wow..all i have to do is follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."" For all of you ""found jeezus"" , how many of you were ""on the brink?""  but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.   We are _just_ animals.  We need sleep, food, and we reproduce.  And we die.  Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG. Some people use drugs as an escape from reality.  Christians inject themselves with jeezus and live with that high.  It pities me how many millions of lives have been lost in religious wars, of which Christianity has had no small part.  When Christians see a ""non-believer"", they say that person is blind to the truth, but they cannot realize that it is _they_ who live with this mask of fakeness each day.  Jesus was just prophet #37696 who happened to have a large influence because at that time the Romans were (circa 69ad) dispersing the Jewish population and communities needed some sort of cohesive element to keep them strong in that time of dire need.  I must go.  These are but a few of my thoughts on Christianity.    -- //Damien Endemyr the Unpure Knight of Doom                          // //""So I've acquired a taste for blood and have adopted a nocturnal  // //lifestyle.

Organization: trunking_fixed Lines: 111  Note: I am cross-posting (actually, emailing) this to bit.listserv.catholic while main posting goes to soc.religion.christian.  [Quotations omitted.  This is in response to a question about the Immaculate Conception.  I explained it, but left justification up to our Catholic readers.  --clh]  There is no direct reference in the Holy Scripture except for the mention of Mary's _blessedness_/full of grace in the ""Annunciation"" by Angel Gabriel in Luke 1:26-28  And in the 6th month the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto a city of Galilee, named Nazareth.  To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin's name was Mary.  And the angel came unto her and said, _""Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women.""_  Now, now, hold that line of thought - ""the Lord is with Mary & blessed art thou among women"" - while you read on....  In the book, ""First Lady of the World, A Popular History of Devotion to Mary"" by Peter Lappin:  The _Immaculate Conception_ matter is really far more complicated than the _Assumption_.  This arose in 430 AD.  It is quite possible that the feast of _Mary's Conception_ under the title ""The Conception of Saint Anne"", originally commemorated the _physical miracle_ of a woman _beyond the age_ of child bearing, conceiving a daughter, just as Elizabeth had conceived John the Baptist.  A transfer in emphasis from the physical miracle wrought in Anne to the miracle of grace wrought by God in the soul of Mary was _logical_.  Mary is the incorruptible timber ""out of which was hewn the _tabernacle_ of Christ's sinless body""; she is ""God's Eden, in whom there is no tree of knowledge, and no serpent that harms.""  Her perfect beauty and spotlessness find their exemplar in Christ, her purity in that of the Father.  At the time of the Council of Ephesus, she was hailed as ""innocent, without blemish, immaculate, inviolate, spotless, holy in soul and body, who was blessed as a lily from among thorns, unlearned in the evil ways of Eve"". ... At the end of the thirteenth century, an Irish Franciscan, John Duns Scotus (1266-1308),...God maintained that it was a greater thing for Him to preserve His (the Son) mother from all sin _than to use His power to clease her from it later_. ...  Now let's go to the discussion of baptism and original sin. From ""Pocket Catholic Cathechism"" by John A. Hardon:  Baptism - Concupiscence Remains after Baptism. Concupiscence or the tendency to sin remains in the baptized but since it is left to provide trial, it has no power to injure those who do not consent and who by the grace of Christ Jesus, manfully resist (Canon 5).  Original gifts of Adam and Eve before their fall: In the light of the foregoing, we see that our first parents were originally gifted three times over: -They had the natural gifts of human beings especially the power to think and to choose freely. -The had the _preternatural_ gifts of bodily immortality and of integrity, or the internal power to control desires. -They had the _supernatural_ gifts of sanctifying grace, the virtues of faith, hope, and charity and the corresponding title to enter heaven. By their disobedience, they lost the _supernatural and preternatural_ gifts entirely, and were weakened (without losing) their natural capacity to reason and to choose freely.  Baptism restores the _supernatural_ life lost by Adam's sin.  It _does not_ restore the _preternatural_ gifts but gifts as a title to a glorified restoration of our bodies on the last day...  Going back to _Immaculate Conception_ (I am not sure if this interpretation is in any other books but it may be another contribution to the 'puzzle'):  Given the miracle of St. Anne bearing a child at a non-childbearing age, AND Christ was not yet born AND _there was no baptism yet_ on Mary's birth but STILL, the Angel Gabriel's greetings was: ""Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with you. Blessed art thou amongst women"".  Even Mary was confused about this greeting.  Mary could very well have possessed all of the _treefold original gifts above_ given to our first parents (Adam and Eve before their sin): Hail Mary (Example of praise given by the Angel Gabriel) Full of grace (natural, preternatural, supernatural) The Lord is with you (At those times, God would definitely want to be with those He has made _blessed_) Blessed art thou amongst women (that says it all)  At the conception, God made Mary _full of grace and blessed_ as the 'tabernacle' for the coming body of Christ and so,  Immaculate Conception of Mary is true and Mary still has maintained her Immaculate Heart.  -Marida (P.S.  I do hope that others will continue more light and facts on this matter.  Thanks.) "

alt.atheism	 Organization: Penn State University From: <SEC108@psuvm.psu.edu> Subject: Why the bible? Lines: 38  One thing I think is interesting about alt.athiesm is the fact that without bible-thumpers and their ilk this would be a much duller newsgroup. It almost needs the deluded masses to write silly things for athiests to tear apart. Oh well, that little tidbit aside here is what I really wanted write about.  How can anyone believe in such a sorry document as the bible? If you want to be religious aren't there more plausable books out there? Seriously, the bible was written by multiple authors who repeatedly contradict each other. One minute it tells you to kill your kid if he talks back and the next it says not to kill at all. I think that if xtians really want to follow a deity they should pick one that can be consistent, unlike the last one they invented.  For people who say Jesus was the son of god, didn't god say not to EVER put ANYONE else before him? Looks like you did just that. Didn't god say not to make any symbols or idols? What are crosses then? Don't you think that if you do in fact believe in the bible that you are rather far off track?  Was Jesus illiterate? Why didn't he write anything? Anyone know?  I honestly hope that people who believe in the bible understand that it is just one of the religious texts out there and that it is one of the poorer quality ones to boot. The only reason xtianity escaped the middle east is because a certain roman who's wine was poisoned with lead made all of rome xtian after a bad dream.

I refer you to the bonobos, a species of primate as closeley related to humans as chimpanzees (that is, very closely). They have sex all the time, homosexual as well as heterosexual. When the group finds food, they have sex. Before the go to sleep at night, they have sex. After they escape from or fight off prdators, they have sex. Sex serves a very important social function above and beyond reproduction in this species. A species closely related to humans. There is some indication that sex performs a social function in humans, as well, but even if not, this shows that such a function is not *impossible*.

If I forgot or botched your favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not* on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure it out, I'll add it to the list.  Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen* acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)  The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.  Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted. Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply different ways of referring to the same thing.  Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu), who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de), who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).  Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.  Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the acronym list in an entertaining fashion.

Organization: AI Programs, University of Georgia, Athens Lines: 39  To recapitulate a bit:  - The essence of marriage is two people's commitment to each other.  - If two people claim to be married ""in their hearts"" but are not willing to have the marriage recognized by church and state, that's prima facie evidence that the commitment isn't really there.  - There are obvious situations in which Christian marriage is possible without a civil or church wedding: if you're stranded on a desert island, or if your state forbids the marriage for an unjust reason (e.g., laws against interracial marriage).  - The legal concept of ""common-law marriage"" is meant to ensure that the state will recognize marriages that did not start out with the usual ceremony and record-keeping.  - Pastorally, I'm concerned that people should not use ""being married in God's eyes"" as an excuse for living together without a formal wedding. One has a duty to have one's marriage properly recorded and witnessed.  - But there are also people who have been through a wedding ceremony without making a genuine commitment, and therefore are not married in God's eyes.

soc.religion.christian	" From: kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu (Dr Nancy's Sweetie) Subject: Re: Certainty and Arrogance Organization: Rowan College of New Jersey Lines: 122  In an earlier article, I explained that what many people find arrogant about Christians is that some Christians profess absolute certianty about their beliefs and doctrines.  That is, many Christians insist that they CANNOT have made any mistakes when discovering their beliefs, which amounts to saying that they are infallible.  Impicitly claiming to be infallible is pretty arrogant, most of us will probably agree.  In short, the problem is that no matter how good your sources are, if any part of your doctrines or beliefs rest on your own thinking and reasoning, then those doctrines are suspect.  So long as your own brain is involved, there is a possibility for error.  I summarised the problem by writing ""There is no way out of the loop.""   Someone called `REXLEX' has claimed that there IS a way out of the loop, but he did not bother to explain what it was, preferring instead to paraphrase Sartre, ramble about Wittgenstein, and say that the conclusion of my argument leads to relativism.  As I have explained to him before, you cannot reject an argument as false because you dislike where it leads: the facts do not change just because you dislike them.  `REXLEX' wrote:  >  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is > taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.  However, as any first-year philosophy student can explain, what `REXLEX' has written does not constitute a refutation.  All he has said is that he does not like what I wrote -- he has done nothing at all to dispute it.  *  There were two sentences in `REXLEX's post that seemed relevant to the point at hand:  >  There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be > experienced and it is verifiable.  I do not dispute that some truths can be verified through experience.  I have, for example, direct experience of adding numbers.  I don't claim to be infallible at it -- in fact I remember doing sums incorrectly -- but I do claim that I have direct experience of reasoning about numbers.  However, once we go past experiencing things and start reasoning about them, we are on much shakier ground.  That was the point of the earlier article.  Human brains are infested with sin, and they can only be trusted in very limited circumstances.   >  It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be absolute > about a thing.  But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, and that Jesus said, exactly, ""This is my body.""  We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  At the moment he stops speaking, and people start interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- substatiation?   He didn't say.  We interpret this passage using our brains; we think and reason and draw conclusions.  But we know that our brains are not perfect: our thinking often leads us wrong.  (This is something that most of us have direct experience of.  8-)  Why should anyone believe that his reasoning -- which he knows to be fallible -- can lead him to perfect conclusions?  So, given the assumptions in this example, what we can be certain of is that Jesus said ""This is my body.""  Beyond that, once we start making up doctrines and using our brains to reason about what Christ revealed, we get into trouble.  Unless you are infallible, there are very few things you can be certain of.  To the extent that doctrines rely on fallible human thinking, they cannot be certain.    That is the problem of seeming arrogant.  The non-Christians around us know that human beings make mistakes, just as surely as we know it.  They do not believe we are infallible, any more than we do.  When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when the person you are talking to believes that you are either too foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying to cover them up.  I think it would be far better to say what things we are certain of and what things we are only ""very confident"" of.  For example, we might say that we know our sin, for recognising sin is something we directly experience.  But other things, whether based on reasoning from Scripture or extra-Biblical thinking, should not be labled as infallible: we should say that we are very confident of them, and be ready to explain our reasoning.  But, so far as I am aware, none of us is infallible -- speaking or acting as if our thinking is flawless is ridiculous.  *  `REXLEX' suggested that people read _He is There and He is Not Silent_, by Francis Schaeffer.  I didn't think very highly of it, but I think that Mr Schaeffer is grossly overrated by many Evangelical Christians.  Somebody else might like it, though, so don't let my opinion stop you from reading it.  If someone is interested in my opinion, I'd suggest _On Certainty_, by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh, Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.

The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft), Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in 1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever. Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions asked.  -- Keith Mancus    <mancus@butch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           | N5WVR           <mancus@sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        | ""Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          | when your back's against the wall...."" -Leslie Fish                  | "

All advice was taken to heart, if not directly used.  My friend found out about the matter quite accidently.  After reading some of my mail, I quit from the mail reader & went about my business.  I must have trashed my mail improperly, because he got on the same terminal the next day & saw my old messages.  He thought they were responses to a post he placed in alt.atheism earlier that week, so he read some of them before realizing that they were for me.  I got a message from him the next day; he apologized for reading my mail & said that he did not want to appear to be a snoop.  He said that he would be willing to talk to me about his views & didn't mind doing so, especially with a friend.  So we did.  I neither changed his mind nor did he change mine, as that was not the point.  Now he knows where I'm coming from & now I know where he's coming from.  And all that I can do is pray for him, as I've always done.  I believe the reason that he & I ""click"" instead of ""bash"" heads is because I see Christianity as a tool for revolution, & not a tool for maintaining the status quo.  To be quite blunt, I have more of a reason to reject God than he does just by the fact that I am an African-American female. Christianity & religion have been used as tools to separate my people from the true knowledge of our history & the wealth of our contributions to the world society.  The ""kitchen of heaven"" was all we had to look forward to during the slave days, & this mentality & second-class status still exists today.  I, too, have rejected an aspect of Christianity----that of the estabished church.  Too much hypocricy exists behind the walls of ""God's house"" beginning with the images of a white Jesus to that of the members:  praise God on Sunday & raise hell beginning Monday.  God-willing, I will find a church home where I can feel comfortable & at-home, but I don't see it happening anytime soon.  Sherlette "

I've known all sorts of Christians, ranging from the trendiest of liberals to the fire-breathing fundamentalists, and although many on the conservative side of the Christian faith do claim that the Bible is a (perhaps *the*) source of absolute truth, I don't know of anyone who treats it as anything other than a valuable part of a living tradition. While I am not a Roman Catholic, I believe this is close to the official position of the RC church (perhaps an RC would like to comment).  The particular practice you refer to will usually be explained in terms of the social context of the time. You would think the fact that the conservatives seem to have to break out the tophat-and-cane and give you some big song-and-dance routine about why this (other passages as well) aren't directly applicable today would show them that what they claim about the Bible and what they actually practice are two different things, but mostly it doens't.  While this thread is supposed to be about the arrogance of Christians, I would suggest that some of the problem is really hypocrasy, in this case, making claims about the Bible which the claimants don't actually put into practice. But if we step back from the name-calling and look at what people are attempting to say, we see that they are trying to express very concisely the unique place the Bible holds within the Christian faith. So when people use such words or phrases as ""Word of God"", ""inerrant"", ""infallibale"", ""The Manufacturer's Handbook"", ""The only rule of faith and practice in the church today"" to describe the Bible, we should try to hear what they are saying and not just look at the mere words they use. Some of the above descriptions are demostratably false and others are self-contradictory, but in my experience people are generally pretty good at picking out the intention of the speaker even when the speaker's words are at variance with their intentions. A Biblical example is from the garden of Eden where God asks ""Where are you?"" and Adam explains that he was naked and afraid and hid himself. If Adam had answered God's words he would have said something like ""I'm here in this tree."" The problem seems to arise when Christians insist that these words are indeed accurate reflections of their beleif. Most people have not made a determined effort to work out their own understanding of the place of the Bible within their own faith and so rely on the phrases and explanations that others use.  I hope this helps. -- ___ Bill Rea                                                            (o o) -------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w--- | Bill Rea, Computer Services Centre, | E-Mail   b.rea@csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | University of Canterbury,           | or     cctr114@csc.canterbury.ac.nz | | Christchurch, New Zealand           | Phone (03)-642-331 Fax (03)-642-999 | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- "

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate project.  But why?

You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development, the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want speed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in service as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less than 18 months after the development go-ahead.  One of the most pernicious myths in this whole business is the belief that you can't build a launcher without taking ten years and spending billions of dollars.  It isn't true and never was.

Am I mistaken with this understanding?  Yes, to some degree. There was an excellent discussion in sci.skeptic on the nature of scientific work two weeks ago, I hope it did not escape your notice.  The correct word is 'likely'. There is no way to be sure our models and theories are absolutely correct. Theories are backed up by evidence, but not proved - no theory can be 'true' in a mathematical sense.  However, theories are not mere descriptions or rationalisations of phenomena. It is extremely important to test whether theories can _predict_ something new or not yet observed. All successful theories science has come up with have passed this test, including the Big Bang theory of cosmic evolution, the theory of natural selection etc. It does not mean they _must_ be correct, but they are not mere 'best fits' for the data.  > = But if you claim that there must be > = an answer to ""how"" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from > = ""nothing"", science has some good candidates for an answer.  > All of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''.  Well, yes, if you want to _believe_ in them. This is not what science requires - take a good look at the theory and the evidence, see if the theory has made any successful predictions, and use your reason. Disbelievers are not punished.  > The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive. > With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.  This is what puzzles me - why do we need to have faith in _anything_? My fellow atheists would call me a weak atheist - someone who is unable to believe, ie, fails to entertain any belief in God.  Yes, I know that one can't believe without God's help; Luther makes this quite clear in his letter to Erasmus. I'm afraid this does not change my situation.  > [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.

Tautology at its best.  > Carefully examine the original question, and then the ""counter-question"". > The first asks ""Why"", while the second is a request for definition.  No, it is not, although it does look like one. This is a true dichotomy, either something exists, or nothing exists. If nothing exists, nobody would ask why. If something exists, it is possible to ask why, but actually no existing being could give an answer.  Imagine, for a moment, that the nobodies in non-existence could also ask: ""Why nothing exists?"" This is equivalent to my counter-question, ""why nothing exists in nothingness"".  Now, ""why anything exists"" is equivalent to ""why something exists in somethingness"".  _This_ is what I meant with my tautology, my apologies for the poor wording in my previous post.  > I might add, the worldview of ""Things that exist do, and things that > don't...don't"" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, > as does the theist's belief in God.

I do indeed think there probably _is_ no reason for being, or existence, in general, for reasons I stated above. However, they will still leave open the question ""why this, and not that"", and this is where theistic explanations come in.  Science cannot give reasons for any _particular_ human being's existence.  > We come to this. Either ""I am, therefore I am."", or ""I am for a reason.""  This is a deep philosophical question - is determinism true, or not? Also, is God deterministic or not? I tend to think this question has no meaning in His case.  If I am for a reason, I've yet failed to see what it would be. From our perspective, it looks like 'I' exist for truly random reasons. I just rolled two dice - why did I get 6 and 1? How can I believe there is any better reason for my existence?  > If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are > satisfied, and need not a doctor.

But this is not the same as the source of all existence.  > This does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His > *qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).  No, it doesn't, but I think an existing God cannot know why He exists, for an answer to this question is not knowable. Of course, this should not be any obstacle to belief in His existence.  > I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer ""why"".   It > appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is > inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting > that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  It is impossible to know unknowable things. However, the question ""why do I exist, in particular"" is _not_ an invalid question - this is not what I said. But from our perspective, it is impossible to tell, and I can't just believe in any given explanation instead of another, especially since I found I was deluding myself.  > My apologies.  I was using why as ""why did this come to be"".  Why did > pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.  I think ""pre-existence"" is an oxymoron. There is no time 'outside' of this spacetime (except in some other universe), and from that perspective, our universe never was. It exists only for those who are inside it.  > But we come to the admission that science fails to answer ""Why?"".

No. The validity of the question has to be discussed separately; I think philosophy is of great help here. What can be known, and what is not knowable?  > M. Pihko does present a good point though.

The reason I am threatened by Science has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence-- God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree, Science.  My problem with Science is that often it allows us to assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us with the ability to produce life through sexual relations, for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone. Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power to decide who should and should not be able to have children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that is made possible.  People have always had the ability to end lives unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially created life is artificially created death, and as God has reserved judgement about when people should die to Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how people should be brought in to the world.  This is not to say that I reject all forms of medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes, go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God gave us?  I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not, but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body they have been given, they should ask themseles why their body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but I will say that each person should pray for guidance when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and should cease their unravelling if they have reason to believe their search is displeasing to God.  ---Malcusco "

I thought the whole idea of God coming down to earth to live as one of us ""subject to sin and death"" (as one of the consecration prayers in the Book of Common Prayer (1979) puts it) was that Jesus was tempted, but did not succumb.  If sin is not part of the basic definition of humanity, then Jesus ""fully human"" (Nicea) would not be ""subject to sin"", but then the Resurrection loses some of its meaning, because we encounter our humanity most powerfully when we sin.

Second, the historical record suggests that the positions attributed to Nestorius were not as extreme as his (successful) opponents (who wrote the conventional history) claimed.  Mainly Nestorius opposed the term Theotokos for Mary, arguing (I think correctly) that a human could not be called Mother of God.  I mean, in the Athanasian Creed we talk about the Son ""uncreate"" -- surely even Arians would concede that Jesus existed long before Mary.  Anyway, Nestorius's opponents claimed that by saying Mary was not Theotokos, that he claimed that she only gave birth to the human nature of Jesus, which would require two seperate and distinct natures.  The argument fails though, because Mary simply gave birth to Jesus, who preexisted her either divinely, if you accept ""Nestorianism"" as commonly defined, or both natures intertwined, a la Chalcedon.  Second, I am not sure that ""Nestorianism"" is not a better alternative than the orthodox view.  After all, I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven; likewise post-Ascension.  I think rather that God came to earth and took our nature upon him.  It was a seperate nature, capable of being tempted as in Gethsemane (since I believe the divine nature could never be tempted) but in its moments of weakness the divine nature prevailed.  Comments on the above warmly appreciated.  Jason Albert  [There may be differences in what we mean by ""subject to sin"".  The original complaint was from someone who didn't see how we could call Jesus fully human, because he didn't sin.  I completely agree that Jesus was subject to temptation.  I simply object to the idea that by not succumbing, he is thereby not fully human.  I believe that you do not have to sin in order to be human.  I again apologize for confusing Nestorianism and monophysitism.  I agree with you, and have said elsewhere, that there's reason to think that not everyone who is associated with heretical positions was in fact heretical.  There are scholars who maintain that Nestorius was not Nestorian.  I have to confess that the first time I read some of the correspondence between Nestorius and his opponents, I thought he got the better of them.  However, most scholars do believe that the work that eventually led to Chalcedon was an advance, and that Nestorius was at the very least ""rash and dogmatic"" (as the editor of ""The Christological Controversy"" refers to him) in rejecting all approaches other than his own.  As regular Usenet readers know, narrowness can be just as much an impediment as being wrong.  Furthermore, he did say some things that I think are problematical.  He responds to a rather mild letter from Cyril with a flame worthy of Usenet.  In it he says ""To attribute also to [the Logos], in the name of [the incarnation] the characteristics of the flesh that has been conjoined with him ... is, my brother, either the work of a mind which truly errs in the fashion of the Greeks or that of a mind diseased with the insane heresy of Arius and Apollinaris and the others.  Those who are thus carried away with the idea of this association are bound, because of it, to make the divine Logos have a part in being fed with milk and participate to some degree in growh and stand in need of angelic assistance because of his fearfulness ...  These things are taken falsely when they are put off on the deity and they become the occasion of just condemnation for us who perpetrate the falsehood.""  It's all well and good to maintain a proper distinction between humanity and divinity.  But the whole concept of incarnation is based on exactly the idea that the divine Logos does in fact have ""to some degree"" a part in being born, growing up, and dying.  Of course it must be understood that there's a certain indirectness in the Logos' participation in these things.  But there must be some sort of identification between the divine and human, or we don't have an incarnation at all.  Nestorius seemed to think in black and white terms, and missed the sorts of nuances one needs to deal with this area.  You say ""I find it hard to believe that pre-Incarnation that Jesus's human nature was in heaven.""  I don't think that's required by orthodox doctrine.  It's the divine Logos that is eternal.  --clh] "

This summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300 participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).  OLYMPUS has been particularly useful : -      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested data transmission, videoconferencing, business television, distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few examples.  -      in opening the door to new telecommunications services which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower- frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.  -      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS received for the first time in Europe, over several months, high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and then distributed it to various centres in Europe.  When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.  OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or services; over the past four years some 200 companies and organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over 100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning organisation.    As the new technologies and services tested by these OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then make use of operational satellites such as those of EUTELSAT.  OLYMPUS utilisation will continue through 1993 and 1994, when the spacecraft will run out of fuel as it approaches the end of its design life.   "

Lines: 40  >If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong, >then I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means.  Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when it comes to their religion. Some take it to the extreme and say that their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings then you won't be ""saved"". It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim to know what God thinks/wants. Especially when it's based upon your interpretation of a book. The logic in the above statement is faulty in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be correct. It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike. No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the other is right. As an example, take the question, ""Is the glass half empty or half full""? You can have two different answers which are contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.  [If a person has what they believe is convincing evidence that God will save only Christians, it's hard to see how you can criticize them for arrogance for saying so.  It could be that they're wrong.  But I hardly see that it's arrogance.  Let's look at this a bit closer. Suppose we had some combination of prophets and messiahs that taught us things, but didn't say anything about exclusivity.  If we believe them, and then add ""and anybody who believes anything else is damned"", then you could well criticize us for arrogance.  But in this case the exclusivity is in the message as it comes from the prophets, etc.  So we could be wrong in believing it, but I don't see how we can be called arrogant.  Maybe the world isn't a soft place.  Maybe certain choices actually do have eternal consequences.  I can see calling the Christian message arrogant, in a certain sense (though only in the same sense as calling the law of gravitation arrogant because it doesn't give us any option over whether we fall if we jump off a building).  But not Christians for passing it on, given that they believe it.  The complaints I can see making are (1) that Christians are wrong, or (2) that God is arrogant.  --clh] "

For providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S. Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind -- and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.  Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters.  When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it, ""defies the best principles of launching payloads into space."" Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these principles that SSRT defies?  Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the ""fact"" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars.  It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.  It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better, cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a little, Test a little.  Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as ""Shape Shifter"" than ""Space Lifter.""  We didn't spend a lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in 18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule.  As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But each step should follow the same principles -- a small management team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest budget.  Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve: (See charts)  I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we could do is soft-land on Earth!  But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land horizontally, etc, etc.  I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You bring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and decade long programs.]  I bet on my generation and Max Hunter's idea -- Any Takers?

Dear Will,  I've never replied on this thing before so I hope it gets thru ok. I had a few thoughts!:  ""Faith on its own, if not accompanied by action is dead"" - James 2:17  Faith is both belief and action. If I say that I am a great swimmer but I never go swimming, am I really a swimmer? and will people believe that I am? Likewise if I say I'm a Christian but I never talk to God, am I really a Christian? My faith is demonstrated by my action. The fact that we talk to God proves we have faith. Satan believes in God but does not follow Him!  In a similar vein, I have recently been challenged by 1John2:3-6 v3 says ""We know that we have come to know Him if we obey His commands"" I find this verse quite encouraging as it could imply that 'if we have come to know Him, then we'll obey His commands' cos He lives within us and we cannot help but obey what He says. I tend to feel that as we daily submit ourself to God He will keep changing us into the likeness of Jesus and His fruit and works will be automatically produced in our lives.  Hope this helps.

In a previous article, Eugene.Bigelow@ebay.sun.com (Geno) says:  >>If I don't think my belief is right and everyone else's belief is wrong, >>then I don't have a belief. This is simply what belief means. > >Unfortunatly, this seems to be how Christians are taught to think when >it comes to their religion.  This is how everyone in the western intellectual tradition is, or was, taught to think. It is the fundamental premis ""A is not not-A"". If a thing is true then its converse is necessarilly false. Without this basic asumption theology and science as we know them are alike impossible. We should distinguish the strong and weak meanings of the word ""believe"", however. The weak sense means I am not sure. ""I believe Tom went to the library."" (but he could have gone to the track). The strong sense means I am so certain that I use it as a basis of thought. ""I believe that nature operates according to certain fundamental laws."" (despite the fact that nature *appears* capricious and unpredictable). Christian belief is of the strong kind. (Though Christians may well hold beliefs of the weak kind on any number of theological and ecclesiological topics.)  >Some take it to the extreme and say that >their religion is the ONLY one and if you don't accept their teachings >then you won't be ""saved"".  Note that these are two separate ideas. Most hold the first view, but the majority do not hold the second. Is is again a matter of pure logic that if Christanity is true, then Hinduism (for example) must necessarilly be false, insofar as it contradicts or is incompatible with, Christaianity. (And, as a matter of *logic*, vice versa.)  >It takes quite a bit of arrogance to claim >to know what God thinks/wants.  It is arrogant to claim to know what *anyone* thinks or wants, unless they have told you. Christians believe God has told us what he thinks and wants.  >Especially when it's based upon your >interpretation of a book.  Most Christians do not base their belief on the Bible, but on the living tradition of the Church established by Christ and guided constantly by the Holy Spirit. The Bible is simply the written core of that tradition.  >The logic in the above statement is faulty >in that it assumes two people with differing beliefs can't both be >correct.  If depends what you mean by differing. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you believe he weighs 200 pounds, our beliefs differ, but we may both be right. If I believe Tom is six feet tall and you beleive that he is four foot nine, one of us, at least, must be wrong.  >It's all about perception. No two people are exactly alike. >No two people perceive everything in the same way. I believe that >there is one truth. Call it God's truth, a universal truth, or call it >what you will. I don't believe God presents this truth. I think it is >just there and it's up to you to look for and see it, through prayer, >meditation, inspir- ation, dreams or whatever. Just because people may >perceive this truth differently, it doesn't mean one is wrong and the >other is right.  Thus you believe that there is a single truth but that no human being can find it. You assert that anyone who believe that we can find absolute truth is mistaken. In short, you believe that anyone who does not share your belief on this point is wrong. QED.  >As an example, take the question, ""Is the glass half >empty or half full""? You can have two different answers which are >contradictory and yet both are correct. So, for your belief to be >true, does not require everyone else's belief to be wrong.  Here I begin to suspect that your real difficulty is not with the knowability of truth, but simply with language. Saying that the glass is half empty is not a contradiction of the statement that it is half full: it is the same fact expressed in different words. (The whole point of this phrase is to illustrate the different ways the pessimist and the optimist express the *same* fact.)  It is, of course, quite true that different people may express the same belief in different words. It is also true that they may fail to understand each other's words as expressions of the same belief and may argue bitterly and believe that they are miles apart. Great scisms have occurred in just this way, and much ecumenical work has been done simply in resolving differences in language which conceal agreement in belief. This does not mean, in any sense, that all beliefs are equally valid. Since some of the beliefs people hold contradict some other beliefs that other people hold, after all obfuscations of language and culture in the expression of those beliefs have been stripped away, some of the beliefs that some people hold must, **necessarilly** be false, and it is neither arrogant nor illogical to say so. If I believe X and you believe Y we may both be correct, but if Y is equivalent to not-X then one of us is wrong and as long as we hold our respective beliefs, we must each regard the other as in error. -- ============================================================================== Mark Baker                  | ""The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts."" -- C.

Hence the image of the Church as a woman, holding a Cross and a Cup, which tell of the Crucifxition of Our Lord, and of the power of His Blood (the grail legend, but also, more significantly, it shows that ""This is the Cup of the New Covenant in my blood, which shall be shed for you and for many."" (Luke 22.20), the Cup represents the New Covenant and holds the blood of redemption).  The fact that the woman is holding both and is said to have the whole world for her seat, is that the Catholic Church is catholic, that is universal, and is found throughout the world, and the Church shows the Crucifixtion and applies the blood of redemption to all mankind by this spread of hers, thorugh which the Holy Sacrafice of the Mass, can be said and celebrated in all the nations as Malachi predicted in Malachi 1.11, ""From the rising of the sun to its setting, my name is great among the gentiles, and everywhere there is sacrafice, and there is offered to my Name a clean oblation, for my Name is great among the gentiles, says the Lord of hosts.""  And so we acknowledge what St. Paul wrote ""For as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you show the Lord's death until he comes."" (1 Corinthians 11.26)  You are quite right about the identification of ""Babylon the Great, Mother of all Harlots"" with Rome.  I think we simply disagree as to what time period of Rome the Apostle John is talking about.  Andy Byler "

Obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a >> contradiction in terms.  I agree with Carol here.  Determining absolutes is, practically speaking, a waste of time.  And we easily forget that relative truth is, in fact relative.  For example, I recently was asking some children the question ""What temperature does water boil at?""  I got the answer 212 degrees consistently.  I asked if they knew what scale, and was told ""It's just 212 degrees.  Any scale. That's what all thermometers say.""  Well, that's sincere, and may be true in the experience of the speaker, but it is simply wrong.  IT is NOT an absolute truth.  Similarly, Scripture is full of Truth, which we should nurture and cherish, but trying to determine which parts are Absolute Truth and which parts are the manifestations of that in the context of the time and culture in which the text was penned is missing the point.  Then religion easily becomes an intellectual head-trip, devoid of the living experience of the indwelling Trinity and becomes dead scholasticism, IMO.  [example of head-covering in Church deleted]  This was a good example.  There may be an Absolute Truth behind the writing, but the simplest understanding of the passage is that the instructions apply to the Corinthians, and not necessarily elsewhere. The instructions may reflect Absolute Truth in the context of first century culture and the particular climate at Corinth, which was having a LOT of trouble with order. Is it Absolute Truth to me?  No.  And I see no compelling, or even reasonable, reason that it should be.  >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) >Can you reconcile this?  Even the most die-hard literalists do not take all of the Bible literally. I've yet to meet anyone who takes the verse ""blessed is he who takes your babies and smashes their heads against the rocks"" literally.  The Bible was not printed or handed to us by God with color codings to tell us what parts should be interpreted which way.  >> Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.

People sometimes disagree about what is true. This does not negate >> the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  I can't prove the existence of absolutes.  I can only rely upon MY experience. I also trust God's revelation that WE cannot fully comprehend the infinite. Therefore we can't comprehend the Absolutes.  So I don't need them. I can never know the essence of God, only the energies by and through which God is manifested to God's creation.  So the reality can be that there ARE absolutes, but it is of no practical importance.  It's like claiming that the original scriptural autographs were perfect, but copies may not be.  Swell. Who cares?  It doesn't affect me in any practical useful way.  I might as well believe that God has made a lot of electric blue chickens, and that they live on Mars.  Maybe God did.  So what? Is that going to have ANY effect on how I deal with my neighbor, or God?  Whether or not I go to this or that cafeteria for lunch?  No.  This attitude leads many non-Christians to believe that ALL Christians are arrogant idiots incapable of critical reasoning.  Christianity is true, wonderful and sensible.  It appeals to Reason, since Reason is an inner reflection of the Logos of God.  Explanations that violate that simply appear to be insecure authoritarian responses to a complex world.  NOTE:  I'm NOT claiming there is no place for authority. That'd be silly. There IS a world of difference between authoritative and authoritarian. Authoritative is en expression of authority that respects others. Authoritarian is en expression of authority that fails to do that, and is generally agressive.  Good parents (like God) are authoritative. Many Christians are simply authoritarian, and, not surprisingly, few adults respond to this treatment.

In fact the longer a hoax is perpetuated the stronger it becomes.  Finally:  There is no proof of the resurrection of Christ, except in our spirits communion with his, and the Father's.  It is a matter of FAITH, belief without logical proof.  Incedently one of the largest stumbling blocks for rational western man, myself included.  I hope that this is taken in the spirit it was intended and not as a rejection of the resurrection's occurance.  I beleive, but I wanted to point out the weakness of logical proofs.

On the one hand there are advantages to having the liturgy stay the same.  John has described some of these.  On the other hand, some people seem to start tuning out `the same old words' and pay attention better when things get changed around.  I think innovative priests and liturgy committees are trying to get our attention and make things more meaningful for us.  It drives me crazy too.  Different people have differing preferences and needs in liturgy.  My local parish is innovative.  I prefer to go to Mass at the next parish over.  Sometimes we don't have the option of attending a Mass in the style which best suits us.  John put a smiley on it but to ""just offer it up"" probably is the solution.  A related issue, that it sounds like John does not have to deal with, is that spouses may have different liturgical tastes.  My husband does like innovative litury.  It is a challenge to meet both of our spiritual needs without just going our separate ways.  When you include the factor of also trying to satisfy our children's needs, things get pretty complicated.  One thing to remember is that even the most uncongenial Mass is still Mass.

This is one of the differences between OT prophecy and NT prophecy.

If you don't give grace to allow people to make mistakes, they will never grow in the use of the spiritual gifts!  When we minister in my small group, I encourage people to speak out any impressions or images they think might be from the Lord.

I have heard his voice -- not audibly (though some have), but clearly nonetheless.  Is what I heard equivalent to Scripture?  No.  I have never heard contemporary prophets claim that what they receive from the Lord is on the same level as Scripture; on the contrary, those who are mature obey the Scriptures by submitting their prophecies to fellow believers for judgement.  And the most reliable yardstick for judging prophecies is, certainly, the Scriptures themselves.  The canon is closed -- but God is not silent!  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture.

(It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.) As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid: - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort (let alone anything else)  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?) So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume.  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that...  -- Wim Lewis, wiml@u.washington.edu

We might call him A bit brutal Though `firm' would be kinder (And no doubt Stalin, who let nobody go, laughed at his laxness) He didn't like his job; perhaps he no longer hoped for better (Nor feared worse, except regarding his head).  And when these wily Jews With their heads-I-win, tails-you-lose conundrums Brought forth their madman, His first impulse was to play the Roman: ``I find nothing wrong with him, See to it yourselves.''  But when they mentioned `King' and `Caesar' His heart froze.

They didn't want the King of the Jews, They wanted Barabbas instead (And, as Josephus records, they got him)  Oh well, he thought, They all look the same to me. And we'll get Barabbas next time.  And if I can get them to say ``We have no king but Caesar!'' By killing a madman, Hell, I'll kill ten a day.

sci.space	" From: jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Josh Hopkins) Subject: DC-Y trajectory simulation Keywords: SSTO, Delta Clipper Organization: University of Illinois at Urbana Lines: 91   I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is granted to copy this without restriction.  Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.  On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled ""Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions"" here at the University of Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.  The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time: ______ 3 G         /|   /      | / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines 2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long. 1 G   /                 | | | 0 G                     |  ^          ^ ~100 sec    ~400 sec   As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below 3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely.  The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to that desired.  Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)  Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than all at once?  A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.  Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?  A:  Can't tell us.  ""Read Aviation Leak.""  He also apparently had a good propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting national security or MD protecting their own interests?  The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar, and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate. The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude.  I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that aspect of the flight profile.  -- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ""Find a way or make one."" -attributed to Hannibal "

It is good to remember that every translation is to some extent an interpretation, so (as you point out below) one must really go back to the original Arabic.  Regarding the verses relevant to nature, I prefer to use Dr. Maurice Bucaille's translations (in his book, ""The Bible, the Qur'an and Science"") for in general his translations are more literal.  Maurice Bucaille translates the portion of the verse you are addressing as  ""...Each one is travelling with an orbit in its own motion.""  (Also note that ""the celestial bodies"" in the first translation quoted by you above is the translator's interpolation -- it is not existent in the original Arabic, which is why it is included in brackets.)  >Perhaps someone who can read the original Arabic can eliminate one of >these interpretations; at any rate, neither one of them is exactly >impressive.  You're right, what the verses _do_ contain isn't all that remarkable.  However, Dr. Bucaille (a surgeon, that's how he's a ""Dr."") thinks it is significant that the above verse contains no geocentric ideas, even though geocentrism was all the rage up until the 17th century (?) or so. (And this goes for the rest of the Qur'an as well, which has about 750 verses or so regarding nature, I think I remember reading once.)  Fred Rice darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au "

Would you not >show up for services if they were called ""Resurrection Sunday Services"" >rather than ""Easter Services""?  There is another way to view this.  The True Celebration is Easter, the Resurrection of Our Lord.  This has been true from the foundation of the world.  Pagan practices are then either:  1. foreshadowings of the True Celebration of the Resurrection, in which dim light was shone forth so that people would recognize the full truth when it was manifested, OR  2. satanic counterfeits intended to deceive us so that we would not recognize the truth when it was manifested.  I don't believe the second argument, because I believe in the power of the Resurrection, the fulfillment of the Incarnation, and our hope. Earlier or parallel ideas in other religions clearly are dim images of the truth of the Resurrection.  As Paul states, we see through a glass darkly.  So do others.  It serves no purpose arguing about who has the darker or lighter glass.  The foreshadowings are not perfect. So what? Our understnding of God is today imperfect, for we are not yet perfected.  Theosis is not a gift such that WHAM, we're perfect.

ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD  On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co- inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D. Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.  Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.  Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.  For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.  The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.  OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

If this is grounded firmly in Islam, as you claim, then you have just exposed Islam as the grounds for terrorism, plain and simple.  Whether you like it or not, whether Rushdie acted like a total jerk or not, there is no acceptable civilized basis for putting someone in fear of their life for words.  It simply does not matter whether his underlying motive was to find the worst possible way he could to insult Muslims and their beliefs, got that? You do not threaten the life of someone for words - when you do, you quite simply admit the backruptcy of your position.  If you support threatening the life of someone for words, you are not yet civilized.  This is exactly where I, and many of the people I know, have to depart from respecting the religions of others.  When those beliefs allow and encourage (by interpretation) the killing of non-physical opposition.  You, or I or anyone, are more than privledged to believe that someone, whether it be Rushdie or Bush or Hussien or whover, is beyond the pale of civilized society and you can condemn his/her soul, refuse to allow any members of your association to interact with him/her, _peacably_ demonstrate to try to convince others to disassociate themselves from the ""miscreants"", or whatever, short of physical force.  But once you physically threaten, or support physical threats, you get much closer to your earlier comparison of rape - with YOU as the rapist who whines ""She asked for it, look how she was dressed"".

UK. Supersedes: <19930322114724@mantis.co.uk> Lines: 632  Archive-name: atheism/logic Alt-atheism-archive-name: logic Last-modified: 5 April 1993 Version: 1.4  Constructing a Logical Argument  Although there is much argument on Usenet, the general quality of argument found is poor.  This article attempts to provide a gentle introduction to logic, in the hope of improving the general level of debate.  Logic is the science of reasoning, proof, thinking, or inference [Concise OED].  Logic allows us to analyze a piece of reasoning and determine whether it is correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one does not need to study logic in order to reason correctly; nevertheless, a little basic knowledge of logic is often helpful when constructing or analyzing an argument.  Note that no claim is being made here about whether logic is universally applicable.  The matter is very much open for debate.  This document merely explains how to use logic, given that you have already decided that logic is the right tool for the job.  Propositions (or statements) are the building blocks of a logical argument. A proposition is a statement which is either true or false; for example, ""It is raining"" or ""Today is Tuesday"".  Propositions may be either asserted (said to be true) or denied (said to be false).  Note that this is a technical meaning of ""deny"", not the everyday meaning.  The proposition is the meaning of the statement, not the particular arrangement of words used to express it.  So ""God exists"" and ""There exists a God"" both express the same proposition.  An argument is, to quote the Monty Python sketch, ""a connected series of statements to establish a definite proposition"".  An argument consists of three stages.  First of all, the propositions which are necessary for the argument to continue are stated.  These are called the premises of the argument.  They are the evidence or reasons for accepting the argument and its conclusions.  Premises (or assertions) are often indicated by phrases such as ""because"", ""since"", ""obviously"" and so on.  (The phrase ""obviously"" is often viewed with suspicion, as it can be used to intimidate others into accepting suspicious premises.  If something doesn't seem obvious to you, don't be afraid to question it.  You can always say ""Oh, yes, you're right, it is obvious"" when you've heard the explanation.)  Next, the premises are used to derive further propositions by a process known as inference.  In inference, one proposition is arrived at on the basis of one or more other propositions already accepted.  There are various forms of valid inference.  The propositions arrived at by inference may then be used in further inference.  Inference is often denoted by phrases such as ""implies that"" or ""therefore"".  Finally, we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which is affirmed on the basis of the premises and inference.  Conclusions are often indicated by phrases such as ""therefore"", ""it follows that"", ""we conclude"" and so on.  The conclusion is often stated as the final stage of inference.  For example:  Every event has a cause (premise) The universe has a beginning (premise) All beginnings involve an event (premise) This implies that the beginning of the universe involved an event (inference) Therefore the universe has a cause (inference and conclusion)  Note that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another argument.  A proposition can only be called a premise or a conclusion with respect to a particular argument; the terms do not make sense in isolation.  Sometimes an argument will not follow the order given above; for example, the conclusions might be stated first and the premises stated afterwards in support of the conclusion.  This is perfectly valid, if sometimes a little confusing.  Recognizing an argument is much harder than recognizing premises or conclusions.  Many people shower their writing with assertions without ever producing anything which one might reasonably describe as an argument.  Some statements look like arguments, but are not.  For example:  ""If the Bible is accurate, Jesus must either have been insane, an evil liar, or the Son of God.""  This is not an argument, it is a conditional statement.  It does not assert the premises which are necessary to support what appears to be its conclusion.  (It also suffers from a number of other logical flaws, but we'll come to those later.)  Another example:  ""God created you; therefore do your duty to God.""  The phrase ""do your duty to God"" is not a proposition, since it is neither true nor false.  Therefore it is not a conclusion, and the sentence is not an argument.  Finally, causality is important.  Consider a statement of the form ""A because B"".  If we're interested in establishing A and B is offered as evidence, the statement is an argument.  If we're trying to establish the truth of B, then it is not an argument, it is an explanation.  For example:  ""There must be something wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not start."" -- This is an argument.  ""My car will not start because there is something wrong with the engine."" -- This is an explanation.  There are two traditional types of argument, deductive and inductive.  A deductive argument is one which provides conclusive proof of its conclusions -- that is, an argument where if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true.  A deductive argument is either valid or invalid.  A valid argument is defined as one where if the premises are true, then the conclusion is true.  An inductive argument is one where the premises provide some evidence for the truth of the conclusion.  Inductive arguments are not valid or invalid; however, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other arguments, and about how probable their premises are.  There are forms of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive nor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive arguments, as they are often viewed as the most rigorous and convincing.  It is important to note that the fact that a deductive argument is valid does not imply that its conclusion holds.  This is because of the slightly counter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more carefully.  Obviously a valid argument can consist of true propositions.  However, an argument may be entirely valid even if it contains only false propositions. For example:  All insects have wings (premise) Woodlice are insects (premise) Therefore woodlice have wings (conclusion)  Here, the conclusion is not true because the argument's premises are false. If the argument's premises were true, however, the conclusion would be true. The argument is thus entirely valid.  More subtly, we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premises, as in:  All fish live in the sea (premise) Dolphins are fish (premise) Therefore dolphins live in the sea (conclusion)  However, the one thing we cannot do is reach a false conclusion through valid inference from true premises.  We can therefore draw up a ""truth table"" for implication.  The symbol ""=>"" denotes implication; ""A"" is the premise, ""B"" the conclusion. ""T"" and ""F"" represent true and false respectively.  Premise Conclusion Inference A        B        A=>B ---------------------------- F        F         T      If the premises are false and the inference F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.  T        F         F      If the premises are true and the conclusion false, the inference must be invalid.  T        T         T      If the premises are true and the inference valid, the conclusion must be true.  A sound argument is a valid argument whose premises are true.  A sound argument therefore arrives at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse valid arguments with sound arguments.  To delve further into the structure of logical arguments would require lengthy discussion of linguistics and philosophy.  It is simpler and probably more useful to summarize the major pitfalls to be avoided when constructing an argument.  These pitfalls are known as fallacies.  In everyday English the term ""fallacy"" is used to refer to mistaken beliefs as well as to the faulty reasoning that leads to those beliefs.  This is fair enough, but in logic the term is generally used to refer to a form of technically incorrect argument, especially if the argument appears valid or convincing.  So for the purposes of this discussion, we define a fallacy as a logical argument which appears to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect when examined more closely.  By studying fallacies we aim to avoid being misled by them.  The following list of fallacies is not intended to be exhaustive.  ARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)  The Appeal to Force is committed when the arguer resorts to force or the threat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It is often used by politicians, and can be summarized as ""might makes right"". The force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.  For example: ""... Thus there is ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who refuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.""  ARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM  Argumentum ad hominem is literally ""argument directed at the man"".  The Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occurs when, instead of trying to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attacks the person or people making the assertion.  This is invalid because the truth of an assertion does not depend upon the goodness of those asserting it.  For example: ""Atheism is an evil philosophy.  It is practised by Communists and murderers.""  Sometimes in a court of law doubt is cast upon the testimony of a witness by showing, for example, that he is a known perjurer.  This is a valid way of reducing the credibility of the testimony given by the witness, and not argumentum ad hominem; however, it does not demonstrate that the witness's testimony is false.  To conclude otherwise is to fall victim of the Argumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in this list).  The circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem is committed when a person argues that his opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of the opponent's particular circumstances.  For example: ""It is perfectly acceptable to kill animals for food.  How can you argue otherwise when you're quite happy to wear leather shoes?""  This is an abusive charge of inconsistency, used as an excuse for dismissing the opponent's argument.  This fallacy can also be used as a means of rejecting a conclusion.  For example:  ""Of course you would argue that positive discrimination is a bad thing. You're white.""  This particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one alleges that one's adversary is rationalizing a conclusion formed from selfish interests, is also known as ""poisoning the well"".  ARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM  Argumentum ad ignorantium means ""argument from ignorance"".  This fallacy occurs whenever it is argued that something must be true simply because it has not been proved false.  Or, equivalently, when it is argued that something must be false because it has not been proved true.  (Note that this is not the same as assuming that something is false until it has been proved true, a basic scientific principle.)  Examples: ""Of course the Bible is true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.""  ""Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody has shown any proof that they are real.""  Note that this fallacy does not apply in a court of law, where one is generally assumed innocent until proven guilty.  Also, in scientific investigation if it is known that an event would produce certain evidence of its having occurred, the absence of such evidence can validly be used to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:  ""A flood as described in the Bible would require an enormous volume of water to be present on the earth.  The earth does not have a tenth as much water, even if we count that which is frozen into ice at the poles.  Therefore no such flood occurred.""  In science, we can validly assume from lack of evidence that something has not occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it has not occurred, however.  ARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM  This is the Appeal to Pity, also known as Special Pleading.  The fallacy is committed when the arguer appeals to pity for the sake of getting a conclusion accepted.  For example:  ""I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don't find me guilty; I'm suffering enough through being an orphan.""  ARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM  This is known as Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To commit this fallacy is to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by appealing to a large group of people.  This form of fallacy is often characterized by emotive language.  For example:  ""Pornography must be banned.  It is violence against women.""  ""The Bible must be true.  Millions of people know that it is.  Are you trying to tell them that they are all mistaken fools?""  ARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM  This fallacy is closely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It consists of asserting that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more likely it is that that proposition is correct.  ARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM  The Appeal to Authority uses the admiration of the famous to try and win support for an assertion.  For example:  ""Isaac Newton was a genius and he believed in God.""  This line of argument is not always completely bogus; for example, reference to an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a discussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clearly between:  ""Stephen Hawking has concluded that black holes give off radiation"" and ""John Searle has concluded that it is impossible to build an intelligent computer""  Hawking is a physicist, and so we can reasonably expect his opinions on black hole radiation to be informed.  Searle is a linguist, so it is questionable whether he is well-qualified to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.  THE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT  The Fallacy of Accident is committed when a general rule is applied to a particular case whose ""accidental"" circumstances mean that the rule is inapplicable.  It is the error made when one goes from the general to the specific.  For example:  ""Christians generally dislike atheists.  You are a Christian, so you must dislike atheists.""  This fallacy is often committed by moralists and legalists who try to decide every moral and legal question by mechanically applying general rules.  CONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION  This fallacy is the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occurs when one forms a general rule by examining only a few specific cases which are not representative of all possible cases.  For example: ""Jim Bakker was an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christians are insincere.""  SWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER  A sweeping generalization occurs when a general rule is applied to a particular situation in which the features of that particular situation render the rule inapplicable.  A sweeping generalization is the opposite of a hasty generalization.  NON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  These are known as False Cause fallacies.  The fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occurs when one identifies something as the cause of an event but it has not actually been shown to be the cause.  For example:  ""I took an aspirin and prayed to God, and my headache disappeared.  So God cured me of the headache.""  The fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occurs when something is assumed to be the cause of an event merely because it happened before the event.  For example:  ""The Soviet Union collapsed after taking up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid atheism for the same reasons.""  CUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC  This fallacy is similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It asserts that because two events occur together, they must be causally related, and leaves no room for other factors that may be the cause(s) of the events.  PETITIO PRINCIPII  This fallacy occurs when the premises are at least as questionable as the conclusion reached.  CIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO  This fallacy occurs when one assumes as a premise the conclusion which one wishes to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephrased so that the fallacy appears to be a valid argument.  For example:  ""Homosexuals must not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any government official who is revealed to be a homosexual will lose his job. Therefore homosexuals will do anything to hide their secret, and will be open to blackmail.  Therefore homosexuals cannot be allowed to hold government office.""  Note that the argument is entirely circular; the premise is the same as the conclusion.  An argument like the above has actually been cited as the reason for the British Secret Services' official ban on homosexual employees. Another example is the classic:  ""We know that God exists because the Bible tells us so.  And we know that the Bible is true because it is the word of God.""  COMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION  This is the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example is the classic loaded question:  ""Have you stopped beating your wife?""  The question presupposes a definite answer to another question which has not even been asked.  This trick is often used by lawyers in cross-examination, when they ask questions like:  ""Where did you hide the money you stole?""  Similarly, politicians often ask loaded questions such as:  ""How long will this EC interference in our affairs be allowed to continue?"" or ""Does the Chancellor plan two more years of ruinous privatization?""  IGNORATIO ELENCHI  The fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consists of claiming that an argument supports a particular conclusion when it is actually logically nothing to do with that conclusion.  For example, a Christian may begin by saying that he will argue that the teachings of Christianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argues at length that Christianity is of great help to many people, no matter how well he argues he will not have shown that Christian teachings are true.  Sadly, such fallacious arguments are often successful because they arouse emotions which cause others to view the supposed conclusion in a more favourable light.  EQUIVOCATION  Equivocation occurs when a key word is used with two or more different meanings in the same argument.  For example:  ""What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it remains free, that users can do what they like with it, we must place a license on it to make sure that will always be freely redistributable.""  AMPHIBOLY  Amphiboly occurs when the premises used in an argument are ambiguous because of careless or ungrammatical phrasing.  ACCENT  Accent is another form of fallacy through shifting meaning.  In this case, the meaning is changed by altering which parts of a statement are emphasized.  For example, consider:  ""We should not speak ILL of our friends"" and ""We should not speak ill of our FRIENDS""  FALLACIES OF COMPOSITION  One fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property shared by the parts of something must apply to the whole.  For example:  ""The bicycle is made entirely of low mass components, and is therefore very lightweight.""  The other fallacy of composition is to conclude that a property of a number of individual items is shared by a collection of those items.  For example:  ""A car uses less petrol and causes less pollution than a bus.  Therefore cars are less environmentally damaging than buses.""  FALLACY OF DIVISION  The fallacy of division is the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like its opposite, it exists in two varieties.  The first is to assume that a property of some thing must apply to its parts.  For example:  ""You are studying at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.""  The other is to assume that a property of a collection of items is shared by each item.  For example:  ""Ants can destroy a tree.  Therefore this ant can destroy a tree.""  THE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT  This argument states that should one event occur, so will other harmful events.  There is no proof made that the harmful events are caused by the first event.  For example: ""If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin and we'll have a nation full of drug-addicts on welfare.  Therefore we cannot legalize marijuana.""  ""A IS BASED ON B"" FALLACIES / ""IS A TYPE OF"" FALLACIES  These fallacies occur when one attempts to argue that things are in some way similar without actually specifying in what way they are similar.  Examples: ""Isn't history based upon faith?  If so, then isn't the Bible also a form of history?""  ""Islam is based on faith, Christianity is based on faith, so isn't Islam a form of Christianity?""  ""Cats are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, dogs are a form of animal based on carbon chemistry, so aren't dogs a form of cat?""  AFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, B is true, therefore A is true"".  To understand why it is a fallacy, examine the truth table for implication given earlier.  DENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false"".  Again, the truth table for implication makes it clear why this is a fallacy.  Note that this fallacy is different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter has the form ""A implies B, A is false, therefore B is false"", where A does NOT in fact imply B at all.  Here, the problem is not that the implication is invalid; rather it is that the falseness of A does not allow us to deduce anything about B.  CONVERTING A CONDITIONAL  This fallacy is an argument of the form ""If A then B, therefore if B then A"".  ARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM  This is the fallacy of asserting that something is right or good simply because it is old, or because ""that's the way it's always been.""  ARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM  This is the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it is the fallacy of asserting that something is more correct simply because it is new or newer than something else.  ARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM  The fallacy of believing that money is a criterion of correctness; that those with more money are more likely to be right.  ARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM  The fallacy of assuming that because someone is poor he or she is sounder or more virtuous than one who is wealthier.  This fallacy is the opposite of the argumentum ad crumenam.  ARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM  This is the incorrect belief that an assertion is more likely to be true the more often it is heard.  An ""argumentum ad nauseum"" is one that employs constant repetition in asserting something.  BIFURCATION  Also referred to as the ""black and white"" fallacy, bifurcation occurs when one presents a situation as having only two alternatives, where in fact other alternatives exist or can exist.  PLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS  This fallacy occurs when a questioner demands a simple answer to a complex question.  NON SEQUITUR  A non-sequitur is an argument where the conclusion is drawn from premises which are not logically connected with it.  RED HERRING  This fallacy is committed when irrelevant material is introduced to the issue being discussed, so that everyone's attention is diverted away from the points being made, towards a different conclusion.  REIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION  Reification occurs when an abstract concept is treated as a concrete thing.  SHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF  The burden of proof is always on the person making an assertion or proposition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad ignorantium, is the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the person who denies or questions the assertion being made.  The source of the fallacy is the assumption that something is true unless proven otherwise.  STRAW MAN  The straw man fallacy is to misrepresent someone else's position so that it can be attacked more easily, then to knock down that misrepresented position, then to conclude that the original position has been demolished.  It is a fallacy because it fails to deal with the actual arguments that have been made.  THE EXTENDED ANALOGY  The fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occurs when some suggested general rule is being argued over.  The fallacy is to assume that mentioning two different situations, in an argument about a general rule, constitutes a claim that those situations are analogous to each other.  This fallacy is best explained using a real example from a debate about anti-cryptography legislation:  ""I believe it is always wrong to oppose the law by breaking it.""  ""Such a position is odious: it implies that you would not have supported Martin Luther King.""  ""Are you saying that cryptography legislation is as important as the struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!""  TU QUOQUE  This is the famous ""you too"" fallacy.  It occurs when an action is argued to be acceptable because the other party has performed it.  For instance:  ""You're just being randomly abusive."" ""So?  You've been abusive too.""   "

soc.religion.christian	" From: REXLEX@fnal.fnal.gov Subject: Assurance of Hell Organization: FNAL/AD/Net Lines: 139  I dreamed that the great judgment morning had dawned, and the trumpet had blown. I dreamed that the sinners had gathered for judgment before the white throne. Oh what weeping and wailing as the lost were told of their fate. They cried for the rock and the mountains. They prayed, but their prayers were too late. The soul that had put off salvation, ""Not tonight I'll get saved by and by. No time now to think of ....... religion,"" Alas, he had found time to die. And I saw a Great White Throne.  Now, some have protest by saying that the fear of hell is not good for motivation, yet Jesus thought it was.  Paul thought it was.  Paul said, ""Knowing therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men.""  Today, too much of our evangelism is nothing but soft soap and some of it is nothing but evangelical salesmanship.  We don't tell people anymore, that there's such a thing as sin or that there's such a place as hell.  As Jayne has said, this doesn't mean we have to come on so strong so as to hit people over the head with a baseball bat.  Yet the fact remains, there is a place called hell.  A place so fearful that God died to save us from having to experience it.  Whatever you or I, as Christians, do, we should do whatever we can to win people to the Lord, if for no other reason, to keep them from going to ""outer darkness."".  Jesus, in Mt. 25, tells us that He didn't prepare hell for people.  He prepared it for the Devil and his angels.  No where in the Bible do I read -anywhere, that God predestined anybody to go to hell.  D.L. Moody use to say that the elect are the ""whosoever will"" and the nonelect are the ""whosoever wont's."" Whether or not that's theologically sound, I couldn't defend, but its practical.  Jesus said to the people of Israel, ""Ye would not.""  Now, some of you may not be students of the Bible, heck -some of you may not be Christians.  Have you ever said to somebody, ""I don't believe in hell.  I believe in the religion of Jesus.""  But did you know that Jesus talked more about hell than He did about heaven!  ""Oh I believe in the religion of the sermon on the mount.""  You find hell taught by Jesus in the sermon on the mount.  You'll read that Jesus talked about the tree being cast into the fire. Several times he talks about hell and about judgment.  In fact, over and over in the synoptics, Matthew, Mark and Luke, Jesus talks about hell.  Not Isaiah. Not Moses.  Not John the Baptist, though he did, but Jesus, the Son of God. The great Beloved One preached about hell because He loved people and didn't want to see them go there.  Now, if there is no hell then Jesus preached in vain.  It was our Lord Jesus, not some angry Baptist preacher, that said, ""where the worm never dies, and where the fire never goes out.""  Jesus said that.  It was Jesus who called hell a ""furnace of fire.""  It was Jesus that used the word, ""condemnation.""  ""And this is the condemnation, that men love darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil.  Jesus said that.  How can we get it across to you that a loving, dying Jesus preached about hell? Not only that, but He went through hell.  That's what Calgary was all about. When my Lord was on the cross, darkness fell.  He called hell, ""outer darkness.""  Do you have this idea that hell is a place where the gamblers are gambling over here, the drunks are getting drunk over there, and the prostitutes are prostituting their bodies over there?  That's not what hell is.  Hell's not a party.  There's no fellowship there.  He called it ""outer darkness.""  ""Outer"" -away from God.  ""Darkness"" -God is light.  No when He was on the cross, He was made sin for you and for me.  God treated Jesus the way sinners have to be treated.  That's is a sobering thought.  As my son would say, an ""awesome"" thought.  ""My God, My God why hast Thou forsaken me?""  Hell is isolation.  There's no fellowship in hell.  There's no friendship in hell.  There's no loving embrace in hell.  There's no hand shake in hell.  There's no word of encouragement in hell.  ""I thirst.""  It goes much deeper than physical thirst.  Hell is eternal craving with no satisfaction.  The man whose life was lived for drugs, will crave it eternally.  The man whose life was lived for the lust of a woman's body, will crave it eternally -and not be satisfied.  One theologian has put it this way and I think it deserves merit.  What is hell?  Hell is just the kind of environment that matches the internal condition of the lost.  In a recent post, I was trying to remember the founder of The Word of Life ministries.  I've remembered his name, Jack Wertzen, and found that the illustration that I gave wasn't his.  His illustration was that he was talking to his barber and his barber's wife and daughter had just recently been saved and he was commenting about it to Jack.  ""They sing these songs and read Bible verses, and their praising this and that -I can't stand it!  Jack, do you think God would send me to hell?""  Jack answered by saying, ""Yes I think he would!"" Of course the barber said, ""What do you mean by that.""  ""Well if you can't stand living at home with your wife and daughter who sing hymns and praises to God now, what would you do in heaven where they'll do it for eternity?  You'd be miserable.  Because God loves you, He'd put you where it would match what you really are.""   It makes a man think.  The crucifixion of Jesus Christ is a fact that necessitates the eternal existence of hell because on the cross He performed an eternal act.  Don't ask me how, I don't know.  But He is God and He is the infinite/eternal and when He died, He died an infinite/eternal death.  It is by that eternal act that He purchased eternal life for the ""whosoever wills.""  He suffered eternal judgment.  A lot of people would like to detour around hell by saying ""Everybody is going to be saved eventually.""  -universalism.  My Bible says no, He'll separate them.  The sheep from the goats.  "".After you die there's a probationary period in which God prepares you for heaven.""  No, my Bible says that ""It is appointed unto men once to die and then comes judgment.""  Some of the cultist believe in annihilation.  After you die, sssswish.  Just like a mosquito you're squished out.  No, in Rev we are told that their is eternal existence in hell just as there is in heaven.  I don't enjoy making these kind of statements and maybe you don't enjoy listening to them, but we have to preach the entire Word of God.  -There is a place called hell.  If I could give one verse of Scripture that could give any hope that people aren't going there, I'd give it to you, but I haven't found it.  That fact that there is a place called hell, the fact that our God is a God of holiness and must judge sin, the fact that He has made us the kind of creatures we are and therefore we're responsible, the fact that He has placed us in a ""uni""verse that has purpose and design behind it, the fact that sin is such an awful thing and the fact that God Himself went through hell to save us from hell leads us to two applications.  1)  As I've already mentioned.  If you are a Christian, you must worn others. Its not good enough to stop and fix their flat tire and not tell them that just around the bend the bridge is out.  ""Knowing therefore the terror of Lord, we persuade men.""  2)  If you haven't accepted Jesus are your Savior, you're taking an awful chance.  As I say to the Jehovah Witnesses (who no longer frequent my door), if you are right and I am wrong, then I will have lived a good life and will die and cease to exist, but if I am right and you are wrong, then you will die and suffer eternal damnation.  I don't mean to make fun at this point, but its like Dirty Harry said, ""You've got to ask yourself, 'Do I feel lucky?'  Well do you?""  ""A man's got to know his limitations.""  Don't be one of the ""whosoever wont's.""  ""Because while I was yet a sinner, He died for me."" ""There's no greater love than this, that a man lay down his life for another."" --Rex  "

It | > states the 7th day( Saturday ) is the Sabbath while most Christian religions | > keep( or atleast go to church ) on Sunday.  What's up? | | This is a frequently asked question.  Every time it arises, it causes | months of debate.  So let me see if I can answer you directly. | Basically it's because the Law was given to Moses as part of a | specific covenanent with the Jews.  Most of us aren't Jews, so we | aren't part of that covenant.  There was an argument early in | Christian history about whether the Mosaic laws should apply to | Gentiles who became Christians.  You can see the account of this | debate in Acts 15.  The main question there was circumcision, but | keeping the Sabbath would be part of it as well.  The apostles | concluded that we need not become Jews in order to become Christians, | and therefore that rules such as circumcision did not apply to us.  1.  The law was known to man before it was revealed on Mount Sinai.  Rom 4:15 notes that ""where no law is, there is no transgression.""  Not only did sin exist before Sinai (Eden), but the Sabbath was kept before it was revealed on Sinai (Ex 16).  2.  The problem with the first covenant was not the law, but the promise which undergirded it.  God wanted to perform his will in the lives of the people, but in their ignorance after 400 years of slavery, they promised ""what ever He says to do we will do.""  That is why the new covenant is based on ""better promises"" (Heb. 8:6).  Rather than do away with the law God promised to ""put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts"" (Heb. 8:10).  3.  Including the Sabbath in the Acts 15 is selective inclusion.  The Sabbath was more important to the Jews than circumcision.  If any attempt had been made to do away with the Sabbath the reaction would have been even more strident than is recorded in Acts 15.  Do not confuse the weekly Sabbath of the Decalogue with the ceremonial sabbaths which could occur at any time of the week and were part of the law (ceremonial) which was *added* because of transgression (of the moral law) (Gal 3:19).  4.  Israel stands for God's people of all time.  That is why God *grafted* the Gentiles in.  Roma 9:4 says that the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the service of God and the promises belong to Israelites.   In explanation Paul makes it clear that being born into Israel is not enough ""For they are not all Israel, which are of Israel"" v 6.  Then in Gal 3:19 he says ""if ye be Christ's, then are ye Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.""  All Christians are Abraham's seed, Jews, Israelites.  Not physically, for that is not the criterion, but spiritually.  We are joint heirs with Jesus based on the promise God made to all his people the Israelites.  | | While Christians agree that the OT Laws do not all apply to us, | because some of them are part of a specific covenanent with the Jews, | we also expect to see some similarity between the things God expected | from the Jews and the things he expects from us.  After all, it's the | same God.  However there are several ways of dealing with this. | | These days the most common approach is to separate the OT commandments | into ""moral"" and ""ceremonial"".  Ceremonial commandments apply only to | the Jews.  They are part of the specific Mosaic covenant.  These are | thinsg like the kosher laws and circumcision.  Moral laws apply to | everyone.  Most of the 10 commands are part of the moral law, except | for the commandment about the Sabbath.  I believe most people who take | this approach would say that the specific requirement to worship on | the Sabbath is part of the ceremonial law, but a general obligation to | worship regularly is part of the general moral law.  Thus Christians | are free to choose the specific time we worship.  People would probably agree but they are wrong.  How can the Sabbath commandment be ceremonial when it is part of a law which predates the ceremonial laws?  You are not free to choose your time of worship.  Even if you were why do you follow a day of worship which has its origins in pagan sun worship.  Would you rather give up a day which God blessed, sanctified, and hallowed in exchange for one which all church leaders agree has not biblical foundation (see Sabbath Admissions in soc.religion.christian.bible-study). | | A more radical approach (which is generally connected with John Calvin | and the Reformed tradition) says that the Law as a whole is no longer | binding.  Instead, we are entirely under grace, and our behavior | should be guided solely by love.  Portions of the OT Law are still | useful as guidance.  But they are not properly speaking legally | binding on us.  In practice most people who take this position do not | believe it is safe to leave Christians without moral guidannce.  While | we may no longer be under Law, as sinners, it's not safe for us to go | into situations with no principles to guide us.  We're too good at | self-justification for that to be safe.  Thus Christians do have moral | guidance, from things like Jesus' teachings, Paul's advice, etc. | These may not be precisely a Law, but they serve much the same | function as, and have largely the same content as, the ""moral law"" in | the previous analysis.  While Calvin would deny that we have a fixed | legal responsibility to worship on any specific day, he would say that | given human weakness, the discipline of regular worship is important. | I do not care what Calvin or any theologian says.  My guide is what God says.  If being not under the law means we do not have to keep the law, why is it that the only section of the law we have trouble with is the Sabbath commandment, which is the only one God thought was important enough to say *REMEMBER*?  If you study the word deeply you will note that the message is that we are no longer under the condemnation of the law but freed by the grace of God.  If a cop pulls me over for speeding, then in court I ask for mercy and the judge does not throw the book at me but gives me grace, do I walk out of the court saying ""I can now go on speeding, for I am now under grace?""  Being under grace I now drive within the speed limit.  Paul adds to it in Rom. 3:31 ""Di we then make void the law through faith?  God forbid: yea, we establish the law.""  ""Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good"" (Rom. 7:12).  | In both analyses, the specific day is not an issue.  As a matter of | tradition, we worship on Sunday as a memorial of Christ's | resurrection.  There's some debate about what Acts shows about early | Christian worship.  The most common analysis is that is shows Jewish | Christians continuing to go to Jewish services on the Sabbath, but | that specifically Christian service were not necessarily held then. | Act 20:7 shows worship on the first day (Sunday), and I Cor 16:2 also | implies gatherings on that day. | | There are a few groups that continue to believe Christians have to | worship on the Sabbath (Saturday).  The best-known are the Seventh-Day | Adventists and Jehovah's Witnesses.  They argue that Act 20:7 is not a | regular worship service, but a special meeting to see Paul off, and | that I Cor 16:2 doesn't explicitly say it's a regular worship service.  Do you prefer implication to fact?  A careful study of the Acts 20 shows that the meeting was on Saturday night and that on Sunday morning Paul did not go to a worship service, but set off on a long journey by foot to Assos.  In ICor 16 there is no way you can equate ""lay by him in store"" with ""go to a worship service."" | | It's clear that this issue was a contested one in Paul's time.  See | Rom 14:5.  Paul's advice is that we should be very careful about | judging each other on issues like this.  One person sees a specific | day as mandated by God, while another does not.  He who observes that | specific day does it in honor of the Lord.  He who believes his | worship is free of such restrictions also does it in honor of the | Lord.  (Those who believe that the Sabbath is still mandated argue | that Paul is not referring to Sabbath worship here.  Note however Col | 2:16, which says something similar but briefer.  It explicitly | mentions Sabbath.)  Wrong.  These are the sabbath days of the ceremonial law, not the Sabbath day of the moral law. | | There are some differences among Christians about use of the word | ""Sabbath"".  Originally the term referred to the 7th Day, the Jewish | day of worship.  Many Christians now use it to refer to Sunday, the | day of Christian worship.  They do this largely so that they can apply | the 4th (or whatever -- there are a couple of different numbering | schemes) commandment to it.  Reformed tradition does not do this.  It | distinguishes between the Sabbath -- which is the observance mandated | for Jews, and the Lord's Day -- which is the free Christian worship. | (The only reference I can find to this in the NT is Rev 1:10.)  There | are also differences about laws regarding this day.  Many Christians | support ""blue laws"", both in secular law and church law, setting aside | that day and causing people to spend it in worship.  The more radical | anti-legal approach sees such regulations as a return to the Jewish | Sabbath, which is not appropriate to the free Christian worship of the | Lord's Day. | Why would you prefer to twist and turn, relying on different arguments which conflict with each other, rather than obey a simple request from a God who loved you enough to die for you.  Jesus died because the law could not be changed.  Why bother to die in order to meet the demands of a broken law if all you need to do is change the law.  Penalties for law breaking means the law is immutable.  That is why it is no sin not to follow the demands of the ceremonial laws.  It will always be a sin to make false gods, to violate God's name, to break the Sabbath, to steal, to kill, etc.  Except it you disagree.  But then your opinion has no weight when placed next to the word of God.  Darius  [It's not clear how much more needs to be said other than the FAQ.  I think Paul's comments on esteeming one day over another (Rom 14) is probably all that needs to be said.  I accept that Darius is doing what he does in honor of the Lord.  I just wish he might equally accept that those who ""esteem all days alike"" are similarly doing their best to honor the Lord.  However I'd like to be clear that I do not think there's unambiguous proof that regular Christian worship was on the first day.  As I indicated, there are responses on both of the passages cited.  The difficulty with both of these passages is that they are actually about something else.  They both look like they are talking about nnregular Christian meetings, but neither explicitly says ""and they gathered every Sunday for worship"".  We get various pieces of information, but nothing aimed at answering this question.  Act 2:26 describes Christians as participating both in Jewish temple worship and in Christian communion services in homes.  Obviously the temple worship is on the Sabbath.  Acts 13:44 is an example of Christians participating in them.  Unfortunately it doesn't tell us what day Christians met in their houses.  Acts 20:7, despite Darius' confusion, is described by Acts as occuring on Sunday.  (I see no reason to impose modern definitions of when days start, when the Biblical text is clear about what was meant.)  The wording implies to me that this was a normal meeting.  It doesn't say they gathered to see Paul off, but that when they were gathered for breaking bread, Paul talked about his upcoming travel.  But that's just not explicit enough to be really convincing.  Similarly with 1 Cor 16:2.  It says that on the first day they should set aside money for Paul's collection.  Now if you want to believe that they gathered specially to do this, or that they did it in their homes, I can't disprove it, but the obvious time for a congregation to take an offering would be when they normally gather for worship, and if they were expected to do it in their homes there would be no reason to mention a specific day. So I think the most obvious reading of this is that ""on the first day of every week"" simply means every time they gather for worship.  I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian worship was.  --clh] "

Each time a member of the one family kills a member of the other, the other family thinks that it is justified in killing a that member of the first family.  Now, let's suppose that this sequence has occurred an infinite number of times.  Or, if you don't like dealing with infinities, suppose that one member of the family goes back into time and essentially begins the whole thing.  That is, there is a never-ending loop of slayings based on some non-existent travesty. How do you resolve this?  Well, they are all murders.  Now, I suppose that this isn't totally applicable to your ""problem,"" but it still is possible to reduce an uninduced system.  And, in any case, the nested ""murderer"" in the definition of murder cannot be infintely recursive, given the finite existence of humanity. And, a murder cannot be committed without a killing involved.  So, the first person to intentionally cause someone to get killed is necessarily a murderer.  Is this enough of an induction to solve the apparently unreducable definition?

Reading newspapers to learn about this kind of stuff is not the best idea in the world.  Newspaper reporters are notoriously ignorant on the subject of religion, and are prone to exaggeration in the interests of having a ""real"" story (that is, a bigger headline).  Let's back up to 1935.  At this point, we have the Masoretic text, the various targums (translations/commentaries in aramaic, etc.), and the Septuagint, the ancient greek translation.  The Masoretic text is the standard Jewish text and essentially does not vary.  In some places it has obvious corruptions, all of which are copied faithfully from copy to copy. These passages in the past were interpreted by reference to the targums and to the Septuagint.  Now, the septuagint differs from the masoretic text in two particulars: first, it includes additional texts, and second, in some passages there are variant readings from the masoretic text (in addition to ""fixing""/predating the various corrupted passages).  It must be emphasized that, to the best of my knowledge, these variations are only signifcant to bible scholars, and have little theological import.  The dead sea scroll materials add to this an ancient *copy* of almost all of Isaiah and fragments of various sizes of almost all other OT books.  There is also an abundance of other material, but as far as I know, there is no sign there of any hebrew antecdent to the apocrypha (the extra texts in the septuagint).  As far as analysis has proceeded, there are also variations between the DSS texts and the masoretic versions.  These tend to reflect the septuagint, where the latter isn't obviously in error.  Again, though, the differences (thus far) are not significant theologically.  There is this big expectation that there are great theological surprises lurking in the material, but so far this hasn't happened.  The DSS *are* important because there is almost no textual tradition in the OT, unlike for the NT. -- C.

At first, the news media seemed entranced by all the new gizmos the military was using, not to mention the taped video transmissions from the missiles as they zeroed in on their targets.  But later, and especially after the bunker full of civilians was hit, they changed their tone.  It seemed to me that they didn't have the stomach for the reality of war, that innocent people really do die and are maimed in warfare.  It's like they were only pro-Gulf-War as long as it was ""nice and clean"" (smart missiles dropping in on military HQs), but not when pictures of dead, dying, and maimed civilians started cropping up.

I have often wondered about this.  I've always thought that the first bomb should have been dropped on Japan's island fortress of Truk.  A good, inpenatrable military target.  The second bomb could've been held back for use on an industrial center if need be.  But I digress.  Yes, I have heard that we found evidence (after the war, BTW) that Japan was seriously considering surrender after the first bomb.  Unfortunately, the military junta won out over the moderates and rejected the US's ulimatum.  Therefore the second bomb was dropped.  Most unfortunate, IMO.  > >> I, for one, don't regret it. > > Nuke a Jap for Jesus! >  I don't regret the fact that sometimes military decisions have to be made which affect the lives of innocent people.

Actually, it was the fact that both situations existed that prompted US and allied action.  If some back-water country took over some other back-water country, we probably wouldn't intervene.  Not that we don't care, but we can't be the world's policman.  Or if a coup had occured in Kuwait (instead of an invasion), then we still wouldn't have acted because there would not have been the imminent danger perceived to Saudi Arabia.  But the combination of the two, an unprovoked invasion by a genocidal tyrant AND the potential danger to the West's oil interests, caused us to take action.  > > [ I've moved a paragraph from here to later on ] >  [...] >> >> If we hadn't intervened, allowing Hussein to keep Kuwait, then it would >> have been appeasement. > > Right.

Hardly.  I didn't say that it's a Good Thing [tm] to kill innocent people if the end is just.  Unfortunately, we don't live in a perfect world and there are no perfect solutions.  If one is going to  resist tyranny, then innocent people on both sides are going to suffer and die.  I didn't say it is OK -- it is unfortunate, but sometimes necessary.  > > I, a moral relativist, am arguing that saturation bombing of German cities at > the end of World War II was (as far as I can see) an evil and unnecessary act.  I would agree that it was evil in the sense that it caused much pain and suffering.  I'm not so sure that it was unnecessary as you say.  That conclusion can only be arrived at by evaluating all the factors involved. And perhaps it *was* unnecessary as (let's say) we now know.  That doesn't mean that those who had to make the decision to bomb didn't see it as being necessary.  Rarely can one have full known of the consequences of an action before making a decision.  At the time it may have seemed necessary enough to go ahead with it.  But don't assume that I feel the bombing was *morally* justified -- I don't!  I just don't condemn those who had to make a difficult decision under difficult circumstances.  > > You, having criticised moral relativism in the past, are now arguing that I am > in no position to judge the morality of allied actions at the end of the > War.

Wrong.  They were neither moral then nor now.  They seemed necessary to those making the decisions to bring a quick end to the war.  I simply refuse to condemn them for their decision. > > Where's your Christian love?  Where's your absolute morality?  Oh, how quick > you are to discard them when it suits you.  As Ivan Stang would say, ""Jesus > would puke!""  One day I will stand before Jesus and give account of every word and action; even this discourse in this forum.  I understand the full ramifications of that, and I am prepared to do so.  I don't believe that you can make the same claim.  > > mathew  And BTW, the reason I brought up the blanket-bombing in Germany was because you were bemoaning the Iraqi civilian casualties as being ""so deplorable"".  Yet blanket bombing was instituted because bombing wasn't accurate enough to hit industrial/military targets in a decisive way by any other method at that time.  But in the Gulf War, precision bombing was the norm.  So the point was, why make a big stink about the relatively few civilian casualties that resulted *in spite of* precision bombing, when so many more civilians (proportionately and quantitatively) died under the blanket bombing in WW2?  Even with precision bombing, mistakes happen and some civilians suffer.  But less civilians suffered in this war than any other iany other in history!  Many Iraqi civilians went about their lives with minimal interference from the allied air raids.  The stories of ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi civilian dead is just plain bunk. Yes, bunk.  The US lost 230,000 servicemen in WW2 over four years and the majority of them were directly involved in fighting!  But we are expected to swallow that ""hundreds of thousands"" of *civilian* Iraqis died in a war lasting about 2 months!  And with the Allies using the most precise bombs ever created at that! What hogwash.  If ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi civilians died, it was due to actions Hussein took on his own people, not due to the Allied bombing.  Regards,  Jim B.   "

I'm new to this group, and maybe this has been covered already, but does anybody out there see the current emphasis on the environment being turned (unintentionally, of course) into pantheism?  I've debated this quite a bit, and while I think a legitimate concern for the planet is a great thing, I can easily see it being perverted into something dangerous.  As evidence, may I quote THE WALL STREET JOURNAL (of all things!), April 2 (Editorial page): ""We suspect that's because one party to the (environmental) dispute thinks the Earth is sanctified.  It's clear that much of the environmentalist energy is derived from what has been called the Religious Left, a SECULAR, or even PAGAN fanaticism that now WORSHIPS such GODS as nature and gender with a reverence formerly accorded real religions.""

This is a good point.

Many of the statements made by the apostles--especially their repeated attempts to give Jesus a sword (give him military power) point to the fact that they didn't realize the true nature of his reign until after the fact.

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the > person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  One rule of thumb is that if a person is making the claim, they are wrong.  I was just reading John 14 this morning (I think that is the right chapter, anyway it is close and I don't have a Bible at work to check with.) and in it Jesus is talking to his disciples about his impending death and he says that he will be going away and then later he will be with them.  He said something along the lines of ""I will be in you and you will be in me.""  (Again I cannot provide the exact quote or citation.)  Anyway, my understanding of this is that the Second Coming will not be an outward event.  It is an inward event, Christ will come to live in our hearts and we will live in him. If you look for a person you will be deceived.  It seems to me that the Jews had been looking for a Messiah that would be a political or military leader and so didn't recognize Jesus when he came.  Jesus tried to show that his Kingdom was not of this earth. A lot of what I have seen written about the Second Coming seems to based on an expectation of Christ coming back and finally taking over the world and running it the way it should be.  It sounds a lot like what the Jews were looking for.  The First Coming wasn't like that and I see no reason for the Second Coming to be like that either.  Oh and by the way, I don't expect it to happen once.  There is no one Second Coming, there are a lot of little ones.  Every time Christ comes into someones heart, Christ has come again.

If they aren't Atheists, >what are they?  When the Quran uses the word *din* it means way of individual thinking, behaving, communal order and protocols based on a set of beliefs. This is often interpreted as the much weaker term religion.  The atheists are not mentioned in the Quran along with Jews, Mushriqin, Christians, etc. because the  latter are all din. To have a din you need a set of beliefs, assumptions, etc, to forma a social code. For example the Marxist have those, such as History, Conflict, etc. That they do not put idols (sometimes they did) to represent those assuptions  does not mean they are any different from the other Mushriq, or roughly polytheists.  There cannot be social Atheism, because when there is a community, that community needs common ideas or standard beliefs to coordinate the society. When they inscribe assumptions, say Nation, or ""Progress is the natural consequence of Human activity"" or ""parlamentarian democracy is doubtlessly the best way of government"", however they individually insist they do not have gods, from the Quranic point of view they do. Therefore by definition, atheism does not exist. ""We are a atheist society"" in fact means ""we reject the din other than ours"".  Atheism can only exist when people reject all the idols/gods/dogmas/ suppositions/.. of the society that they part, and in that case that is a personal deviation of belief, and Quran tells about such deviations and disbelief. But as I mentioned, from a Quranic point of looking at things, there is no Atheism in the macro level.  I think it took more than one minute.  Kutluk "

Yes, long before Star Trek.  Before Einstein, in fact.  Vulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation of Mercury's orbit that could not be explained by the known planets.

It is about grace and the love of God. Most people would agree with that concerning the younger son. The elder son is simply a negative example of the some thing. He thinks that he must earn his father's love, that he has earned it, that he is entitled to it. His father tells him that he is on the wrong track. He has always been loved--for the same reason his brother has always been: he is his father's son.  We are too performance oriented to consistently get the point.

I think your question should be rephrased. The many verses of the Bible which condem homosexuality (by our beliefs) have been shoved down the throats of homosexuals for a long time by (well-meaning?) Christians. The question is how do they interpret these verses. Any discussion of any issue (this or any other issue) requires a proof of your case as well as a disproof of the opposing view. We are already familiar with those verses and many have proven to themselves that these condem homosexual behaviour. We must now establish reasons for not believing this to be true based on the interpretation of these scriptures given by someone who has come to grips with them.  Todd...

Your very starting point is wrong.  Christianity is not based on following a moral standard.  ""For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith... NOT BY WORKS so that no man may boast.""  (Eph. 2:7-8)  You say that you know the Bible well, and can recognize (do you mean recite?) many passages from memory.  That could very well be so.  However, it looks like there are a few more passages that you should pay attention to.  (Titus 3:5 and James 2:10 are among them.)  Obedience to the moral law is imporant.  However, it is supposed to be the result of turning your life over to Christ and becoming a Christian.

soc.religion.christian	" From: jemurray@magnus.acs.ohio-state.edu (John E Murray) Subject: quality of Catholic liturgy Organization: The Ohio State University Lines: 37  I would like the opinion of netters on a subject that has been bothering my wife and me lately: liturgy, in particular, Catholic liturgy.  In the last few years it seems that there are more and more ad hoc events during Mass.  It's driving me crazy!  The most grace-filled aspect of a liturgical tradition is that what happens is something we _all_ do together, because we all know how to do it.  Led by the priest, of course, which makes it a kind of dialogue we present to God.  But the best Masses I've been to were participatory prayers.  Lately, I think the proportion of participation has fallen, and the proportion of sitting there and watching, or listening, or generally being told what to do (which is necessary because no one knows what's happening next) is growing. Example.  Last Sunday (Palm Sunday) we went to the local church.  Usually on Palm Sunday, the congregation participates in reading the Passion, taking the role of the mob.  The theology behind this seems profound--when we say ""Crucify him"" we mean it.  We did it, and if He came back today we'd do it again.  It always gives me chills.  But last week we were ""invited"" to sit during the Gospel (=Passion) and _listen_.  Besides the Orwellian ""invitation"", I was really saddened to have my (and our) little role taken away.  This seems typical of a shift of participation away from the people, and toward the musicians, readers, and so on.  New things are introduced in the course of the liturgy and since no one knows what's happening, the new things have to be explained, and pretty soon instead of _doing_ a lot of the Mass we're just sitting there listening (or spacing out, in my case) to how the Mass is about to be done.  In my mind, I lay the blame on liturgy committees made up of lay ""experts"", but that may not be just.  I do think that a liturgy committee has a bias toward doing something rather than nothing--that's just a fact of bureaucratic life--even though a simpler liturgy may in fact make it easier for people to be aware of the Lord's presence.  So we've been wondering--are we the oddballs, or is the quality of the Mass going down?  I don't mean that facetiously.  We go to Mass every Thursday or Friday and are reminded of the power of a very simple liturgy to make us aware of God's presence.  But as far as the obligatory Sunday Masses...maybe I should just offer it up :)  Has anyone else noticed declining congregational participation in Catholic Masses lately?  John Murray "

(As usual, the current edition of the Catholic Encyclopedia is frustratingly vague.)  I do know that the priest is viewed as a witness, and thus in some sense would not be required.  However part of the purpose of formal marriage is to avoid any ambiguity about who has and has not taken on the commitment.  The community provides support to marriage, and in cases of problems are involved in helping to make sure that the people carry out as much of their commitment as possible.  Thus marriage must be a public commitment.  The presence of a priest is required for a regular marriage.  Where I'm not clear is exactly where the boundaries are in exceptional cases (""valid but irregular"").  Ne Temere (1907) says that no marriage involving a Catholic is valid without a priest (according to the Oxford Dictionary of the Church), and they imply that the new canon law retains this, but I'd rather see a more recent and authoritative source.  Note that while a Catholic priest is required for Catholics, the Catholic church does recognize marriage between baptized non-Catholics as valid without a priest.  --clh] "

Good point.  The New Testament does not quote Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther, Ruth, Job, Ecclesiastes, or Song of Songs, just as it does not quote from the Deuterocanon.  But if the non-quotation of the former does not disqualify them, neither does the non-quotation of the later.

Not all accepted them as Scripture, though niether were all the books of the New Testament so accepted, which puts to the lie the whole argument of the books being excluded because they were debated and not universally accepted.  Hebrews, the Apocalypse, 2 Peter, Esther, and others were debated at various times, but eventually retained.  As for the Codexes you mention, both Vaticanus and Sinaitcus include the Deuterocanon, bothe of the New and Old Testaments, and Vaticanus (I think) inlcudes 1 Clement, the Shepard of Hermas, and the Epistle of Baranabas.  As for the Muratorian Canon, it deals with the New Testament only, though it is very valuable in its witness to those books.  > My interim conclusion is that Protestant exclusion of > (at least one of) these writings is one of those 'traditions > of men' one hears of so often.

Which ought to quiet those who assert ""in the name of Holy Scripture we do understand those books of whose authority there was never any doubt in the Church,"" as the Episcopal Church does in removing the Deuterocanon from the realm of Scripture.  (Though the Episcopalians hold them in high regard and read them in the Church, they are not counted as Scripture by them, and may not be used to prove dogma.  The Lutherans hold out similarly.) Earlier mention of the so-called Apocrypha as divine scripture can also be found, and below I inlcude only a portion of the quotes calling it divine scripture that could be found among the writings of the Fathers.  ""And this is the reason why the Law of the old Testament is reckoned as consisting of twenty-two books: so that they may correspond to the number of letters [in the Hebrew alphabet].... It is to be noted also that by adding to these Tobias and Judith, there are twenty-four books, corresponding to the number of letters used by the Greeks."" -St. Hillary of Poitiers, ""Commentaries on the Psalms,"" prologue, 15 (365 AD)  ""The twenty-two books according to the Hebrews are .... Jeremiah, with Lamentations and the Letter, reckoned as one .... and [also] there is Maccabees."" -Origen, ""Commentaries on the Psalms,"" Psalm 1 (245 AD)  ""Divine Scripture, addressing itself to those who love themselves and to the boastful .... says most excellently [Baruch 3.16-19 follows]."" -St. Clement of Alexandria, ""The Instuctor of Children,"" 2, 3, 36, 3, (203 AD)  ""....I learned accurately the books of the Old Testament ... Proverbs of Solomon, and also Wisdom ..."" -St. Melito of Sardes, fragment found in Eusebius' ""History of the Church,"" and dating from crica 177 AD, Book 4, 26, 14  ""It is likewise decreed: Now, indeed, we must treat of the divine Scriptures: what the universal Catholic Church accepts and what she must shun.  The list of the Old Testament .... Wisdom, one book; Ecclesiasticus, one book .... Tobit, one book .... Judith, one book; of Maccabees, two books."" -St. Damasus I, Pope, ""The Decree of Damsus,"" section 2 (382 AD)  I would think this enough, though more can be shown, that the Church has always accepted the deutero-canon, though parts have been disputed by various persons.  For if disputes involving the New Testament deutero-canon does not disqulaify those books (i.e. Hebrews, James, 2 Peter, 2&3 John, Jude, Revelation) in Protestant eyes, than neither should it disqulaify the Old Testament books.  And I must point out that the Jews only drew up their canon in 90 AD, 60 years after the founding of the Christian Religion upon the Cross.  Why should we adhere to a canon that was drawn up by the faithless, in reaction to the Chrsitian use of the Greek Septuagint, which includes the deutero-canon?  As early as 150 AD, St. Justin had already accused the Jews of mutilating the Canon of Scripture by their removal of certain books.  Protestants apparently prefer to think that God's revelation was limited by a decree of the Jews in the ordering of their (the Jews') faithless canon, and that he could not use other people, like the Apostles, in drawing up the canon.  The Apostles were most certain users of the Septuagint, as some 80% of the Old Testament quotes use the wording of the Septuagint, and not the Hebrew.  And the Septuagint includes the Deuterocanon. "

If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being? Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite it's basically patriarchical structure?  She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin, but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.  She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God, and everything that flows from that relationship.  The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in the early Church use this particular figure a lot.)  Eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense.  Mary is the mother of all the living in the order of grace.

Ludwig was a desciple of Russell. Ludwig's fame is often explained by the fact that he spawned not one but two significant movements in contemporary philosophy. Both revolve around Tractatus Logico-Philosphicus ('21) and Philosophical Investigation ('53).  Many of Witt's comments and implicit conclusions suggest ways of going beyond the explicit critique of language he offers.  According to some of the implicit suggestions of Witt's thought, ordinary language is an invaluable resource, offering a necessary framework for the conduct of daily life.  However, though its formal features remain the same, its content does not and it is always capable of being transcended as our experience changes and our understanding is deepened, giving us a clearer picture of what we are and what we wish to say.  On Witt's own account, there is a dynamic fluidity of language.   It is for this reason that any critique of language must move from talking about the limits of language to talking about its boundaries, where a boundary is understood not as a wall but a threshold. vonWrights's comment that Witt's ""sentences have a content that often lies deep beneath the surface of language.""  On the surface, Witt talks of the insuperable position of ordinary language and the necessity of bringing ourselves to accept it without question.  At the same time, we are faced with Witt's own creative uses of language and his concern for bringing about changes in our traditional modes of understanding.  Philosophy, then, through more perspicacious speech, seeks to effect this unity rather than assuming that it is already functioning. Yes?  The most brilliant of scientists are unable to offer a foundation for human speech so long as they reject Christianity! In his Tractatus we have the well nigh perfect exhibition of the nature of the impasse of the scientific ideal of exhaustive logical analysis of Reality by man. Perfect language does not exist for fallen man, therefore we must get on about our buisness of relating Truth via ordinary language.  This is why John's Gospel is so dear to most Christians.  It is so simple in it conveyance of the revealation of God, yet so full of unlieing depth of understanding.  He viewed Christ from the OT concept of ""as a man thinketh, so he is.""  John looked at the outward as only an indicator of what was inside, that is the consciousness of Christ.  And so must we.  Words are only vehicals of truth.  He is truth.  The scriptures are plain in their expounding that there is a Truth and that it is knowable.  THere are absolutes, and they too are knowable.  However, they are only knowable when He reveals them to the individual.  There is, and we shouldn't shy from this, a mysticism to Christianity.  Paul in ROm 8 says there are 3 men in the world.  There is the one who does not have the Spirit and therefore can not know the things of the Spirit (the Spirit of Truth) and there is the one who has the Spirit and has the capacity to know of the Truth, but there  is the third.  THe one who not only has the Spirit, but that the Spirit has him! Who can know the deep things of God and reveal them to us other than the Spirit.  And it is only the deep things of GOd that are absolute and true. There is such a thing as true truth and it is real, it can be experienced and it is verifiable.  I disagree with Dr Nancy's Sweetie's conclusion because if it is taken to fruition it leads to relativism which leads to dispair.

I have found that this isn't a very effective argument.  Most atheists are perfectly willing to acknowledge the existence and ministry of Jesus--but are quite capable of rationalizing the miracles and the resurrection into misunderstandings, hoaxes, or simple fabrications.  They can always make an analogy with the _Iliad_, a book that tells the story of the historical Trojan War, but also talks about gods and goddesses and their conversations. I don't think it's possible to convince atheists of the validity of Christianity through argument.  We have to help foster faith and an understanding of God.

I've attempted to come to terms with it previously >(in an attempt to understand it for learning purposes) and haven't been able >to grasp the reasoning. > It was a gift from God.  I think basically the reasoning was that the tradition in the Church held that Mary was also without sin as was Jesus. As the tenets of faith developed, particularly with Augustine, sin was more and more equated with sex, and thus Mary was assumed to be a virgin for life (since she never sinned, and since she was the spouse of God, etc.) Since we also had this notion of original sin, ie. that man is born with a predisposition to sin, and since Mary did not have this predisposition because she did not ever sin, she didn't have original sin.  When science discovered the process of conception, the next step was to assume that Mary was conceived without original sin, the Immaculate Conception.  Mary at that time appeared to a girl named Bernadette at Lourdes.  She refered to herself as the Immaculate Conception.  Since a nine year old would have no way of knowing about the doctrine, the apparition was deemed to be true and it sealed the case for the doctrine.  RCs hold that all revelation comes from two equally important sources, that being Sacred Scripture and Holy Tradition.  In this case, mostly tradition.  Joe Moore

Please spread the word!  Here's some information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have some money available...  John Spencer, 1993/04/21  Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21, (21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;  1993 May 1-2  A-ring ingress  18:27 egress   19:30 B-ring ingress  19:51 egress   21:42 C-ring egress   23:00 Saturn ingress  23:59 egress   10:02 B-ring ingress  10:28 egress   12:19 A-ring ingress  12:40 egress   13:43  1993 July 20-21  Saturn ingress  21:16 egress   05:08 A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing) egress   09:38  Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris, and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus' orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my attention.  THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?  Jay Goguen (jdg@scn5.Jpl.Nasa.Gov) writes:  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia, etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible, except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3 airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.  Jay  and again:  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.  jay  ___    _____     ___ /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

There is also some money for a set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.  Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.

Of course I believe in Predestination.  It's a very biblical doctrine as Romans 8.28-30 shows (among other passages).  Furthermore, the Church has always taught predestination, from the very beginning.  But to say that I believe in Predestination does not mean I do not believe in free will.  Men freely choose the course of their life, which is also affected by the grace of God.  However, unlike the Calvinists and Jansenists, I hold that grace is resistable, otherwise you end up with the idiocy of denying the universal saving will of God (1 Timothy 2.4). For God must give enough grace to all to be saved.  But only the elect, who he foreknew, are predestined and receive the grace of final perserverance, which guarantees heaven.  This does not mean that those without that grace can't be saved, it just means that god foreknew their obstinacy and chose not to give it to them, knowing they would not need it, as they had freely chosen hell. ^^^^^^^^^^^ People who are saved are saved by the grace of God, and not by their own effort, for it was God who disposed them to Himself, and predestined them to become saints.  But those who perish in everlasting fire perish because they hardened their heart and chose to perish.  Thus, they were deserving of God;s punishment, as they had rejected their Creator, and sinned against the working of the Holy Spirit.  >yes, it is up to God to judge.  but he will only mete out that >punishment at the last judgement.  Well, I would hold that as God most certainly gives everybody some blessing for what good they have done (even if it was only a little), for those He can't bless in the next life, He blesses in this one.  And those He will not punish in the next life, will be chastised in this one or in Purgatory for their sins.  Every sin incurs some temporal punishment, thus, God will punish it unless satisfaction is made for it (cf. 2 Samuel 12.13-14, David's sin of Adultery and Murder were forgiven, but he was still punished with the death of his child.)  And I need not point out the idea of punishment because of God's judgement is quite prevelant in the Bible.  Sodom and Gommorrah, Moses barred from the Holy Land, the slaughter of the Cannanites, Annias and Saphira, Jerusalem in 70 AD, etc.  > if jesus stopped the stoning of an adulterous woman (perhaps this is not a >good parallel, but i'm going to go with it anyway), why should we not >stop the murder and violation of people who may (or may not) be more >innocent?  We should stop the slaughter of the innocent (cf Proverbs 24.11-12), but does that mean that Christians should support a war in Bosnia with the U.S. or even the U.N. involved?  I do not think so, but I am an isolationist, and disagree with foreign adventures in general.  But in the case of Bosnia, I frankly see no excuse for us getting militarily involved, it would not be a ""just war.""  ""Blessed"" after all, ""are the peacemakers"" was what Our Lord said, not the interventionists.  Our actions in Bosnia must be for peace, and not for a war which is unrelated to anything to justify it for us.  Andy Byler "

Matthew Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material posted by Yoshiro Yamada (yamada@yscvax.ysc.go.jp).  US PLANETARY MISSIONS   MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)  MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.  MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).  MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.  MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the geological and biological sense.  MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface of an ocean.  MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic measurements of MARINER 4.  MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed.  MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.  MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover, plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974 to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.   PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)  PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.  PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to 36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6 through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7, and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.  PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER 11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever to do so.  PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER 12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus 2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before its batteries failed.   RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)  RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.  RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit. RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.  RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside, the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.  RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon and drifted off into solar orbit.  RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.   LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)  LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside. All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S. probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.   SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)  The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.  Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7, the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored the Tycho crater region in 1968.   VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)  VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June 19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.  The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the engineers' efforts through May of 1983.  An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.  VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in 1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut down on April 12, 1980.  The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.   VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)  VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March 5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7, 1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto, but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.  Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.  When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance. The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids, kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.  VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts, continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10 satellites and one more ring were discovered.  In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather, including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)  The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause.   SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS  Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:   SOVIET LUNAR PROBES  LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first craft in solar orbit. LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959. LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959. ZOND 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since LUNA 3. Was also a test for future Mars missions. LUNA 9 - First probe to soft land on the Moon in 1966, returned images from surface. LUNA 10 - First probe to orbit the Moon in 1966. LUNA 13 - Second successful Soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966. ZOND 5 - First successful circumlunar craft. ZOND 6 through 8 accomplished similar missions through 1970. The probes were unmanned tests of a manned orbiting SOYUZ-type lunar vehicle. LUNA 16 - First probe to land on Moon and return samples of lunar soil to Earth in 1970. LUNA 20 accomplished similar mission in 1972. LUNA 17 - Delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the Moon's surface, LUNOKHOD 1, in 1970. A similar feat was accomplished with LUNA 21/LUNOKHOD 2 in 1973. LUNA 24 - Last Soviet lunar mission to date. Returned soil samples in 1976.   SOVIET VENUS PROBES  VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions lost enroute in 1961. VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in February of 1966. No images were returned. VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface. Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966. VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles similar in 1969. VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in 1972. VENERA 9 - Sent first image of Venusian surface in 1975. Was also the first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar mission. VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982. VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission. VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO. VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in March of 1986.   SOVIET MARS PROBES  MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased enroute the following year. ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965. MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red Planet in 1971. MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971. MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to fire, probe went on into solar orbit. MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in 1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S. probe MARINER 9. MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface. MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit with its flyby bus. PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to human/computer error. PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week before scheduled Phobos landing.  While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon, Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen.   JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS  SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for a Japanese spacecraft.  During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).   HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24, 1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.  The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March 19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.  Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15, 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the approach:  Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane) Period		: 4.7 days   PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES  I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions, and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.  Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library. Some of the more recently published works can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market bookstore.  General Overviews (in alphabetical order by author):  J.

Other works and periodicals:  NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study some of the books listed above.  Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER, SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.  More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions, but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you probably know.  Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue, Pasadena, California 91106 USA.  Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Unfortunately, this isn't true.  On another news group earlier this year, someone posted that the King James Bible was the divinely inspired version of the Bible in English and was, therefore, inerrant; all other English translations were from Satan, trying to deceive the body of Christ.  A few years ago, the pastor of a church I was attending showed me a poster advertising the availability of a certain man to address congregations. Very prominantly on the poster was the fact that the man used only the KJV.

All five schools of law (to the best of my knowledge) support the death sentence for apostasy WHEN it is accompanied by open, persistent, and aggravated hostility to Islam. Otherwise I agree, there is no legal support for punishment of disbelief. The Qur'an makes it clear that belief is a matter of conscience.

soc.religion.christian	 From: conditt@tsd.arlut.utexas.edu (Paul Conditt) Subject: Latest on Branch Davidians Organization: Applied Research Laboratories, University of Texas at Austin Lines: 28  Most of you will have probably seen the news by the time you read this, but the Branch Davidian compound is no more.  This morning about 6:00, the feds punched holes in the compound walls by using a tank.  They then started using non-lethal tear gas.  Shortly after noon, 2 cult members were seen setting fire to the compound.  So far, about 20-30 people have been seen outside the compound.  The fate of the other 60 or 70 people is unknown, neither is the fate of the 17 children that were inside.  The compound did burn to the ground.  Koresh, who at times has claimed to be the Messiah, but then backed off and only claimed to be a prophet, had promised several times to come out peacefully if his demands were met.  First, he demanded that his message be broadcast on the radio, which it was, but he didn't come out. He claimed to be waiting for a message from God.  Finally, he said that God told him that he needed to decipher the mystery of the 7 seals in Revelation, and when he was finished, he'd come out.  He finished the first one, but didn't do any more work that anyone knows of since then. The federal agents did warn him that if they didn't come out, they would be subjected to tear gas.  I think it's really sad that so many people put their faith in a mere man, even if he did claim to be the son of God, and/or a prophet.  I think it underscores the importance of putting you faith only in things that are eternal and knowing for yourself what the Scriptures say and what they mean, instead of relying on others to do it for you, even if those others are learned and mean well.

However, the rumors >I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter >seems more likely.  Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the ""External Tank"" and ""Wingless Orbiter"" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have been dropped, such as using the ""giant external fuel tanks used in launching space shuttles,"" and building a ""station around an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.""  Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in today's Times).  Option ""A"" - Low Cost Modular Approach This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside, there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this option are: -  Uses ""Bus-1"", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this for the Air Force. -  A ""Power Station Capability"" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights. SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle flies in an ""arrow mode"" to optimize the microgravity environment. Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power source for 30 day missions. -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions. The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability. -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and add another 20 kW of power -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module, the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return Vehicle).  Option ""B"" - Space Station Freedom Derived The Option ""B"" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin. This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we have all come to know and love :)  This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option ""A""). Also, the number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit, for both options ""A"" and ""B"".  The build-up occurs in six phases: -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when it visits. -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power. -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply). -  A ""Two Fault Tolerance Capability"" is achieved after 14 flights, with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal control system radiator, and more propulsion modules. -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power, the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the assembly in 24 flights.  Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, with the exception of the data management system, which has major changes.  Option C - Single Core Launch Station. This is the JSC lead option. Basically, you take a 23 ft diameter cylinder that's 92 ft long, slap 3 Space Shuttle Main Engines on the backside, put a nose cone on the top, attached it to a regular shuttle external tank and a regular set of solid rocket motors, and launch the can. Some key features are: - Complete end-to-end ground integration and checkout - 4 tangentially mounted fixed solar panels - body mounted radiators (which adds protection against micrometeroid & orbital debris) - 2 centerline docking ports (one on each end) - 7 berthing ports - a single pressurized volume, approximately 26,000 cubic feet (twice the volume of skylab). - 7 floors, center passageway between floors - 10 kW of housekeeping power - graceful degradation with failures (8 power channels, 4 thermal loops, dual environmental control & life support system) - increased crew time for utilization - 1 micro-g thru out the core module "

On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer (MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.  3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.  4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network) advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone 70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.  5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:  a)  System Power Margin -  68 watts b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 21 degrees off-sun (lagging) and 5 degrees off-earth (leading) e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1 f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within acceptable range g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS, EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within acceptable range j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours Time To Initiation - 184 hours   TRAJECTORY  As of noon Thursday, April 22, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  Distance from Earth         169,747,800 km (1.14 AU) Distance from Sun           286,967,900 km (1.92 AU) Heliocentric Speed          91,200 km per hour Distance from Jupiter       532,735,900 km Round Trip Light Time       18 minutes, 58 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC  1.  As of April 22, 1993, a total of 70185 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65077  were initiated in the sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process. In the past week, one real time command was transmitted: one was initiated in the sequence design process and none initiated in the real time command process. The only command activity was a command to reset the command loss timer. ___    _____     ___ /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right (so far, I've announced that space is a vacuum)?  The people who lived during the time Jesus lived (especially disciples) were taught this:  ""I tell you the truth, anyone who has faith in me will do what I have been doing.  He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.  And I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Son may bring glory to the Father.  You may ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it."" (John 14:12-14) So, Jesus asked them to pray for things in his name.  Since that time, the request has been the same, not to ask for intercession from other beings, but from Jesus.  Remember that ""there is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all men--the testimony given in its proper time."" (1 Timothy 2:5-6.  Also, ""there have been many of those priests [talking about priests among the Hebrews], since death prevented them from continuing in office; but because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.  Therefore he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them."" (Hebrews 7:23-25).  Hebrews is also full of areas talking about Jesus being our mediator rather than any other man.  Joe Fisher  [""The people before Jesus didn't have Jesus, right"" may not be as obvious as you think.  In what sense to you mean didn't have? Christian thought has generally said that they had Jesus in the sense that they were saved by his death.  God is not bound by our chronology.  So in some real spiritual sense they did ""have Jesus"". Even in terms of knowledge, while they surely didn't have the explicit knowledge that we have, Christians have normally seen messianic prophecy as knowledge of Jesus, even if knowledge from afar. --clh] "

Sooner or later your father and his pals will lend money to someone who eventually goes broke, and then they will realise that they havn't been managing risk very well.   Then they will ask themselves what it is that they need to quantify risk, and to persuade borrowers not to take on greater loans than they can carry.    And since they don't all want the worry of doing the calculations and handling the money, some of them will specialise in that.

From a theological bent, those who lived immediately after the flood, such as Noah, Ham, his son Cush, and his son Nimrod had a much stronger appreciation of Divine wrath.  They also had a stronger understanding of the True God.  In fact, this immediacy was a cause of hardship for some, so much so that Atlas, who is seen with heavens resting on his shoulders.  But this is not merely the physical heavens that he is lifting. It is to put God and the strict spirituality of His law at a distance, and thus he became the ""Elevator of the heavens.""  This ""god"" made men able to ""feel"" as if heaven were afar off and ""as if either the God of Heaven could not see through the dark cloud, or did not regard with displeasure the breakers of His laws.""  It is interesting to see that it was that was titled ""Emancipator"" or ""Deliverer""  or Phoroneus. It was Nimrod who invaded the patriarchal system and abridged the liberties of mankind, yet was worship for having given many benefits.  He was a deliverer all right but not as we think of Christ as a Deliverer.  One delivered from a conscious feeling of God's wrath, the other actually performed a delivery from Gods wrath and it is up to us to accept it as true.  >The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is >an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to consign Adam >or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  I don't see the problem.  From the time of Adam, those who looked forward to the coming ""Anointed One"" and put their faith in the fact that it was God who was to do the provision, were accounted as righteous.  But up to the Crucifixion, their sins were only covered, not taken away.  Therefore, the dispensation of the Church views the accountability of sin the same, but see it as a completed action.  Rom's makes it clear that it has always been salvation via faith and nothing else.  >It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The >relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely >extended conditions of Greenwich mean time.  I understand what you're trying to convey, but I don't think I'd lay hold of it because the scriptures do equate the eternality of the second death with the eternality of, say the Church ruling with Christ.

That is a very interesting study.  >The similarity in the midst of great variety of >expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately >after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  Yes, that is my point.  But it is a two edged sword. For some do not want the underlying reality to be revealed.  They were not known as ""mystery"" religions for no reason.  There was the public side of them and there was the private side, that was so protected that the initiates to an oath of death if they revealed that private side.  That is why it is so hard to bring their teachings to light. The ""Mystery of Iniquity"" that we find in the Bible, correlates to this I think.  The primary object of the mysteries was to introduce privately, little by little, under the seal of secrecy and sanction of oath, what it would not have been safe to openly profess was the true religion.  Case in point today might be the Masons.  (Just a note, that they too worshipped Osiris in Egypt, who can be traced to Nimrod, the ""husband son."")  >On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity >that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the >human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is >created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas >dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does >today.  No, I disagree with you here Gerry.  I know what you're alluding to in that the church, primarily the RCC, did endorse Aristotelian philosophy into their worldview, but I would disagree with you that it originated in Greece.  If you are a student of history, you will come to see that much of what Greece came to expound to the world as their original, was just an adulteration of that which they had taken from conquered countries.  The soul is clearly mentioned and discussed at length in the Egyptian religions. As was the unity of God and also the trinity of God.  See if you can find Wilkinson's ""Egyptians.""  He really does a number on what the Greeks did to what they ""pilfered"" from the Egyptians.  > He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same >time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our >eternal spiritual being had grown dim.

Each age has its own focus of theology.  The early church struggled with the Trinitarian formulation.  The reformation dealt with authority.  Today, eschatology has had much study.  The early creeds do not spell these things out in detail because, 1) they weren't the topic of concern, 2) there was insufficient wisdom accumulated, 3) they didn't have the exegetical tools that we have today.  Also, each age seems to have an air of revelation to it.  One age has a well tended and cultivated garden in which a particular doctrine is given growth.  It would be natural for the end of times to have the garden appropriate for the growth of eschatology, wouldn't it? > tangents, never ending tangents, Rex "

This  point is difficult to substantiate since it is not well defined (a great many religious arguments work in that way), but consider the many Aztec warriors who sacrificed themselves to their gods in the belief that this act would bring them victory of the Spanish invaders.  The list is endless.  The Aztecs lost, BTW.  >Call me a fool, but I believe he did heal people.  That is perfectly reasonable, but it is not grounds for me (or anyone) to become a christian.

This is (unfortunately) what alot of religious discussions I have had with people result in - quoting the bible.  The only reasonable way I think people can look at the bible is to treat the stories as some sort of metaphorical representation of the messages that the authors were trying to present.  If someone tries to interpret parts of the bible literally, he or she will end up in all sorts of shit.  Tony's argument would be perfectly reasonable for people who believe the events described in the bible took place, but to convince someone, who thinks the bible is total fiction, that Jesus is real by quoting the book is totally pointless.  For example, in mathematics you cannot say ""a is equal to b because a is equal to b"".    >	I don't think most people understand what a Christian is.

But no matter how you interpret that passage, I do accept your worship on Sunday as being done in honor of the Lord, in contrast with what many of my fellow SDA believers may believe.  To me, though, the bible overwhelmingly points to Saturday as the day to be kept in honor of creation and of God's deliverance of the Israelites from Egyptian bondage.  To those who would attempt to point out that my observance of Saturday is being legalistic, this is simply not the case.

The idea was introduced to me once that the reason Paul wanted the Corinthians to lay aside money for the collection on the first day of the week was because that was when they received their weekly wages.  Paul wanted them to lay aside money for the collection as first priority, before spending their money on other things.  I do not have any proof in front of me for this though, although it would explain why they would lay aside money in their homes instead of a meeting.  >So I think the most obvious reading of this is that ""on the first day >of every week"" simply means every time they gather for worship. > >I think the reason we have only implications and not clear statements >is that the NT authors assumed that their readers knew when Christian >worship was.

As I can find no Scripture (have I missed it ?) that details when you are married, I have to make some assumptions based on the PRINCIPLES of Scripture.  It seems to me that it takes 3 parties to make a marriage: husband-to-be, wife-to-be, and God.  If you promise before each other and God that you will convenant together to be married, then...you are (IMO).  So why do we have the ceremonial part ?  That seems to be there for ""connectedness"" in the Body of Christ.  My brothers and sisters ought to be involved so that there can be some accountability on both our parts.  That's part of the concept from Hebrews about ""not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together as is the custom of some.""  We need each other because Lone Ranger Christians and Lone Ranger Marriages smack of a self sufficiency that the I don't see in the NT.  Does anyone see the Paul Simon ""I am a rock, I am an island..."" model anywhere in Christianity. (Song lyrics show your age :-) ) ?  Further, since marriage is a legal matter/institution in the USA and many other places, and such laws do not specifically go crosswise to the clear teachings of Scripture, we ought to obey them to avoid even the appearance of ""evil"" (I Thess 5:22)  So this would imply at least a civil ceremony before marriage, but keep in mind we are at least doing all of this for the conscience of others because back to the beginning...you are married when you and your intended promise each other and God to be in convenant. (IMO)  What ch'all think ?  Bobby - akgua!rjb  [In some states, the kind of commitment described in Richard Szanto's posting can create a common law marriage.  Indeed his posting itself might go a long way towards establishing that a marriage exists, should the issue ever end up in court.

If this had happened 2000 years ago can you imagine what . . .  Why do you assume that Jesus's plea to His Father ""to let this cup pass from Him"", was merely a plea to escape death?  When I look at Jesus in the garden, I see a Man-God, who all His life had had the presense of His Father with Him.  As a result, He knew every detail about His death long before the Agony in the Garden.  But as that hour approached, He felt abandoned by His Father, His presense diminishing with each passing minute.  In addition, it was brought more and more to Jesus's attention (the betrayal of Judas was probably a big impact) that His suffering would be to no avail for many people, especially those who would reject Him, not only then but in the future.  I truly believe that the majority of Jesus's suffering was mental and spiritual, while the physical portion was only the tip of the iceburg.  BTW, we know from John's account that Jesus *shunned* becomming an earthly king.  From John:  JOH 6:14    After the people saw the miraculous sign that Jesus did, they began to say, ""Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world."" JOH 6:15    Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and make him king by force, withdrew again to a mountain by himself.  This does not seem like a man who would regret not becoming an earthly king.  No, Jesus knew His mission was to redeem all (Jew & Gentile) people and establish His kingdom in the hearts of those who would believe.  This was utterly mistaken, much to Jesus's dismay, as an aspiration to some earthly kingdom.  But He knew what His Father's will was and followed it obediently even in the darkness of His Passion.  -- John G. Ata - Technical Consultant | Internet:  ata@hfsi.com HFS, Inc.

Well, this particular thread of vituperation slopped its venom over into alt.atheism, where we spend most of our time entertaining arguments against our belief system, without resorting to accusing others of bigotry.  It's somewhat ironic that our exposure to bigotry happens in this instance to have originated in rec.scouting, since I always understood scouting to teach tolerance and diversity.  I understand bigotry to be irrational prejudice against other people who happen to be of a different race, religion, ethnic background, sex, or other inconsequential characteristics.  All the evidence I've seen indicates that sexual orientation and lack of belief in gods are exactly such inconsequential characteristics.  Thus, pending further evidence, I conclude that those who show prejudice against such people are bigots, and organizations that exclude such people are discriminatory. -- Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

Here again, the problem with most of the individuals posting here, you take the biblical account as though it were some sort of historical recounting in the modern sense.  I would refer you to John Dominic Crossans Book _The Cross That Spoke_ (Pub. Harper and Row, 1988).  The earliest texts which we have make no reference to an empty tomb.  Nor is an empty tomb necessary for a claim of resurrection. Modern Evangelicals/Fundamentalists have completely missed what the point of resurrection is -- Here the work of George Nickelsburg's work _Resurrection, Immortality, and Eternal Life in Intertestamental Judaism_ (Publ Cambridge, Havard Univ. Press, 1972) is most helpful.  Look At Rom 1:1-3.  Paul here has no need of an empty tomb.  Additionally in 1 Cor 15, Here again there is no mention of an empty tomb. He was raised (note the passive), he appeared, no ascension either.  Resurrection could be accomplished without ever disturbing the bones in the grave.  The whole idea of an empty tomb isn't broached in any of our texts until well after the fall of Jerusalem.  By that time, the idea of coming up with a body would have been ludicrious.  Moreover Mack has argued (convicingly, I think) that the empty tomb story first appears in Mark (we have no texts before this which mention the tomb).   > > Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body.

soc.religion.christian	" From: qtm2w@virginia.edu (Quinn T. McCord) Subject: Questions from a newbie Organization: University of Virginia Lines: 56   Is life a pass/fail course, and does God grade on a curve? I'm new here, and only vaguely religious, but I want to know what some of you people think.  Specifically, are there an infinite number of Heavens, and a person goes to the one that he/she deserves?  Or is it simply Heaven or nothing (Hell?) Also, are we ""graded"" by those around us, or has there always been some unchanging method?  Is the person's childhood taken into account? I'm sure these must sound like over-simplifications to most of you, but I figure that you're the experts.  -Quinn  [Eschatology is an area on which Christians do not agree.  I suspect that's because our primary source of information is prophets and visionaries, and their writings tend to be highly symbolic.  However both Jesus' teachings in the Gospels and books such as the Revelation to John talk primarily about the difference between eternal life and eternal death.  On a number of occasions Jesus does say things that imply some sort of differentiation, e.g. Lk 10:14 and a number of similar passages where Jesus says things like ""even XXX will be better off than you in the judgement.""  Also, I Cor 3 talks about someone who gets into heaven, but by the skin of his teeth, as it were.  But these passages are not normally interpreted as suggesting separate heavens, so much as differing levels of prestige or punishment in heaven or hell (and not all Christians would even go as far as that).  The only Christian group I know of that believes in multiple heavens is the Mormons, and they are very far from mainstream Christianity (far enough that many of our readers would not call them Christian).  Their ideas in this area involve specific Mormon revelations, in addition to the Bible and ""Holy Tradition"" of a more generic Christian sort.  Note that many Christians will cringe at the very thought of associating grading with God.  The whole point of Christ was to free us from the results of a test that we couldn't possibly pass.  If you like test analogies, God grades on a very strict and unbending scale, but he also cheats -- he replaces our test papers with an exam that was prepared by the teacher, before actually doing the grading. Because some people end up in heaven and others in hell, it's easy to see why you'd be inclined to think of it as grading.  While there are differences among branches of Christianity on details, I think we all agree that in one way or another, God cheats.  I am personally very sceptical about anyone who claims to know exactly how far God's cheating extends.  Will he accept people who don't explicitly acknowledge Christ, but somehow still follow him in their hearts?  Many Christians believe that this is possible, at least in principle, but certainly not all do.  Jesus provided us with a clear description of how to be saved, but it's not clear to me that he provided an exact description of how he's going to place the dividing line.  Certainly he made it clear that we can't expect to know whether other individuals are saved or not.  --clh] "

There is really nothing else to discuss.  Trying to cloud the issue with comparisons to Blacks or other minorities is also meaningless because it's like comparing apples to oranges (i.e., people can't control their race but they can control their behavior).  What else is there to possibly discuss on rec.scouting on this issue? Nobody, including BSA, is denying anybody the right to live and/or worship as they please or don't please,  but it doesn't mean that BSA is the big bad wolf for adhering to the recognized, positive, religious and moral standards on which our society has been established and on which it should continue to be based. -- Stan Krieger                 All opinions, advice, or suggestions, even UNIX System Laboratories     if related to my employment, are my own.

As much as some people accept their Church, their priests or straight from their own scriptures as the ""proof"", this does not satisfy atheists.  Atheists DO believe in recognisable authorities.  If they were as dogmatic as you claim they are, they would be trying to prove 1 + 1 =2 every time they got up.  What they dispute is that Churches, priests, scriptures etc. represent true authorities and know the TRUTH.  > To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny > God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very > nature, prove anything.

I am also of the opinion that salvation is by faith alone, based on Ephesians 2 and Romans 3:21-31.  I also conclude that James 2, when read in context, is teaching bullet (2) above. When James speaks of justification, I would claim that he is not speaking of God declaring the believing sinner innocent in His sight (Paul's use of the word). Instead he is speaking of the sinner's profession of faith being ""justified"" or ""proven"" by the display of good works. Also according to James 2, the abscence of such works is evidence for a ""dead"" or ""useless"" faith which fails to save.  James 2 is not a problem for the doctrine of salvation by faith if it is teaching (2).  Works would have their place, not as merit toward salvation, but as evidence of true faith.

This is a common misconception.  There was nothing ""off the wall"" about the Wright Brothers.  They were in correspondance with a number of other experimenters (Octave Chanute, Lillienthal, etc), they flew models, they had a wind tunnel.

soc.religion.christian	" From: simon@monu6.cc.monash.edu.au Subject: Saint Story St. Aloysius Gonzaga Organization: Monash University, Melb., Australia. Lines: 113  Heres a story of a Saint that people might like to read. I got it from a The Morning Star, and am posting it with the permission of the editor.   Saint Aloysius Gonzaga  The Patron of Youth   The marquis Gonzaga had high aspirations for his son, the  Prince Gonzage.  He  wanted  him  to become a famous, brave and honoured soldier. After all, he must carry on the  great  family  name  of Gonzaga.  Of  course, he was to become far more famous, brave and honoured than his father could ever have imagined; though not  in the manner expected.  Saint Aloysius' mother was a woman who received immense joy  from praying  to  God  and  meditating on the divine mysteries and the life of Our Lord. She had little time for the pleasures  of  this life.  As  Saint  Aloysius	grew, he began to resemble his mother more than his father.  Saint Aloysius had learned numerous expressions from his father's soldiers,  but the moment he discovered that they were vulgar, he fainted from shock. This shows his immense hatred of sin (What an example for us of the contempt we must have for sin).  About the time of his First Holy  Communion  (which  he  received from  the  Archbishop  of  Milan,  Charles Borromeo, whom himself became a great Saint), he con-secrated  his  purity  to  God  and asked the Blessed Virgin to protect his innocence for life.  He wanted to share Our Lord's suffering to	show  his  reciprocal love.  He  started by denying his passions; he avoided eating the finest foods, wearing the best clothes, and would put  pieces  of wood  in his bed in order to mortify himself for the love of God. While he was in his early teens his  father  sent  him  (and  his younger  brother)  to  the court of the Spanish King, Phillip 11. Obediently, he set out to make the best of it. He mixed  in  well with  the people of the royal court, for he was handsome, polite, intelligent and always had something interesting to say.   Not long before this time, the great soldier-saint,  Saint	Igna- tius  of  Loyola,  had founded the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits) towards which Saint Aloysius   -12-        began to have a yearning. When he finally told  his  father,  the marquis flew into a rage and forbade his son to become a priest.  After a short time, his father sent him to the  great  cities  in order that he be tempted away from the priesthood, but even  through these trials, Saint Aloysius grew in his desire  for  the religious life and was strengthened in the virtue of purity.  The Marquis' plans were obviously failing, so he con-fronted  his son:  ""Will  you or will you not obey me and forget this foolish- ness?"" ""I will not, father,"" was the  in-evitable  reply.	""Then leave from my sight and don't return until you change your mind!"" With tears clouding his eyes, the Saint left the  room  to	pray: ""Tell  me Lord, what am I to do? Tell me! Tell me!"" He knelt down to flagellate himself as he had done several  times  before,  but this  time	he was seen. The onlooker rushed to the marquis. This at last brought the proud man to his senses. ""The Lord wants him, the Lord can have him."" He gave his consent for his son to become a Jesuit.  After some years (at the end of the sixteenth century), a  terri- ble  epidemic  broke out in Rome. All the hospitals were full and could house no more, so the Jesuits opened their own. Saint Aloy- sius  did  all he could in the hospitals, particularly to prepare the dying for a holy death.  Saint Aloysius himself contracted the plague  from	carrying  and nursing  the  sick.  For three months he lay with a burning fever and finally, on June 21st, 1591, he gave his  soul	to  the  Lord while gazing at a crucifix.  Let us invoke Saint Aloysius as our patron and imitate him in his humility, purity and confidence in prayer.  Saint Aloysius Gonzaga, pray for us.  - Brendan Arthur       Prayer is as necessary to a person consecrated to the service  of others as a sword is to a soldier  God Bless  From Simon Lines:  106 -- /----------------------------------------------------------------|-------\ |  Simon P.

The New Testament does >record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really >guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.  Of course they knew where it was. Don't forget that Jesus was seen by both the Jews and the Romans as a troublemaker. Pilate was no fool and didn't need the additional headaches of some fishermen stealing Jesus' body to make it appear He had arisen. Since Jesus was buried in the grave of a man well know to the Sanhedrin, to say that they didn't know where He was buried begs the question.  Now, you say that you think that the disciples stole the body. But think on this a moment. Would you die to maintain something you KNEW to be a deliberate lie!? If not, then why do you think the disciples would!? Now, I'm not talking about dying for something you firmly believe to be the truth, but unbeknown to you, it is a lie. Many have done this. No, I'm talking about dying, by beheading, stoning, crucifixion, etc., for something you know to be a lie! Thus, you position with regards to the disciples stealing the body seems rather lightweight to me.  As for graverobbers, why risk the severe penalties for grave robbing over the body of Jesus? He wasn't buried with great riches. So, again, this is an argument that can be discounted.  That leaves you back on square one. What happened to the body!?

An objective truth that says one cannot know the objective truth? Interesting notion.   :-)  Certainly one can have as one's morals a belief that compromise is good.

Almost invariably when considering the relative value of one thing over another, be it morals or consequences, people only consider those aspects which justify a desired action or belief.  In justifying a commitement to peace I might argue that it lets people live long & healthy and peaceful lives.  While that much may well be true, it is incomplete in ignoring the benefits of war - killing off the most agressive member of society, trimming down the population, stimulating production.  The equation is always more complex than presented. To characterize relative morals as merely following one's own conscience / desires is to unduly simplify it.  -- Ray Fischer                   ""Convictions are more dangerous enemies of truth ray@netcom.com                 than lies.""  -- Friedrich Nietzsche "

Now, your position (so far as I can gather) is that God exists, but the descriptions atheists have been presented with are simply bad descriptions of It. This is roughly analogous to someone who has never seen a bicycle, and, when they ask for a description from people who claim to have seen one, are told that it is a ""Euclidean circle-square"".

Is anyone out there in Christendom listening? If so, why don't we get some dialog going here?  Here's a topic to get things started. My daughter's Christian school sends home a weekly update on school related topics. This week they sent something *very* interesting. It was an article written by the leader of a national (US) Christian school organization about a trip he recently made to Jerusalem. While there, he was introduced to one of the rabbis who is working on a project to rebuild the Temple at Jerusalem. The article included photos of the many furnishings that have already been made in preparation for furnishing the rebuilt temple according to the specifications given in the Bible.  What was even more striking is the fact that the plans for the temple are complete and the group is only awaiting permission from the Israeli government before beginning the building. The other startling fact is the very recent archeological discovery that the original site of the temple is unoccupied and available for building. Previously it has been thought that the original site was underneath what is now a mosque, making rebuilding impossible without sparking a holy war.  Now it appears that nothing stands in the way of rebuilding and resuming sacrifices, as the Scriptures indicate will happen in the last days. Although the Israeli government will give the permission to start, I think it is the hand of God holding the project until He is ready to let it happen. Brothers and sisters, the time is at hand.

The thrust of my argument here is that  (a) Salameh is, according to US law, innocent as he has not been found guilty in a court of law.  As his guilt has not been established, it is wrong for people to make postings based on this assumption.  (b) Islam teaches us _not_ to harm innocents.  If Muslims -- who perhaps have not realized that Islam teaches this -- perform such actions, it is _not_ _because_ of the teachings of Islam, but rather _in spite of_ and _in contradiction to_ the  teachings of Islam.  This is an important distinction.  I should clarify what Muslims usually mean when they say ""Muslim"".  In general, anyone who calls themselves a ""Muslim"" and does not do or outwardly profess something in clear contradiction with the essential teachings of Islam is considered to be a Muslim.  Thus, one who might do things contrary to Islam (through ignorance, for example) does not suddenly _not_ become a Muslim.  If one knowingly transgresses Islamic teachings and essential principles, though, then one does leave Islam.  The term ""Muslim"" is to be contrasted with ""Mu'min"", which means ""true believer"".  However, whether a Muslim is in reality a Mu'min is something known only by God (and perhaps that person himself).  So you will not find the term Mu'min used very much by Muslims in alt.atheism, because it is not known to anybody (except myself and God), whether I, for example, am a ""true believer"" or not.  For example, I could just be putting on a show here, and in reality believe something opposite to what I write here, without anyone knowing.  Thus, when we say ""Muslims"" we mean all those who outwardly profess to follow Islam, whether in practice they might, in ignorance, transgress Islamic teachings.  By ""Muslim"" we do not necessarily mean ""Mu'min"", or ""true believer"" in Islam.  Fred Rice darice@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au  "

Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars, M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time, they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the galaxy. Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE. Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I suppose you are saying, ""Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk.""  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different, and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this. I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources. When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk, but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of these characteristics.  I think that's all of it...if someone needs clarification, or knows something that I don't know, by all means correct me.  I had the honor of taking the Bursts class with the person who has done the modeling of these different distributions, so we pretty much kicked around every possible distribution there was, and some VERY outrageous sources. Colliding pulsars, black holes, pulsars that are slowing down...stuff like that.   It's a fun field. Complaints and corrections to: belgarath@vax1.mankato.msus.edu or post here. -jeremy   "

The magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration? Can this be extended to larger accelerations?  Thanks is advance... -Amruth Laxman  "

The term god is used in a different way usually. When you use a different definition it is your thing, but until it is commonly accepted you would have to say the way I define god is ... and that does not exist, it is existence itself, so I say it does not exist.  Interestingly, there are those who say that ""existence exists"" is one of the indubitable statements possible.

An atheist is one for whom all things can : be understood as processes of nature - exclusively.  This definition does not include all atheists (see the FAQ). However, I (for one) do think there is no need to invoke any divine or spiritual explanations.  It makes a big difference to claim that all things can be understood as natural processes, and to claim that our observations do not require us to postulate any divine intervention, or anything spiritual, for that matter. Humans are not omnipotent, and neither is science. However, science has one advantage theology doesn't: it is self- correcting, with nature as its judge.  It is delightful to see how scientific inquiry is revealing a self- consistent, simple picture of our universe. Science is no longer a bunch of separate branches, it is one. From particle physics to psychology. And no aspect of our life, or our universe, is safe from its stern and stony eye. Not even our consciousness.

Actually, determinism vs. indeterminism is a philosophical question, and science cannot say whether the whole thing is actually somehow superdeterministic or not. I think the question does not have any meaning, as far as individual human beings go. If their apparent free will is an illusion, it does not appear to be so from their perspective. Bill, can you say _for sure_ whether you have a free will or not?  : This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all : its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it : acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident.  Maybe. Who are we to tell? It seems intelligence is useful - when during the history of Earth has _one species_ been able to control one third of the whole biosphere? This can still be a result of numerous happy accidents our genetic machinery blindly replicates and preserves. Even that machinery can be result of the same principle - only the systems that can start replicating will survive, those which don't don't make it. (Recommended reading: t.o)  : For an atheist, no : event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less : value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- : an event can have value.  From whose perspective? I value events and things subjectively, from my perspective. Nature does not have values, because it does not have a perspective - values arise from awareness. If I have a subjective perspective, it is easy to assume that other people also do, and if I think about what it would it be like in their position, I will eventually discover the Golden Rule. Morality is not necessarily a gift from heavens, in fact, it may be a product of evolution. Perhaps we are aware of ourselves because a sense of identity is helpful, allows us to play the roles of others and make us respect others who seem to have identity, too.  Bill, have you ever read Aristotle? Try his Ethica Nikomakhea (sp.) for starters.  : How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing : the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On : what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It : seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you : have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what : in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to : establish your values.  C.S. Lewis tells us that this argument was the main reason why he abandoned his atheism and became Christian. The argument is severely flawed.  Some values, such as the Golden Rule, can have a rational basis. Some others, like the basic idea of wanting to live, has probably its roots in the way our brains are wired. Lewis ignored the very real possiblity that natural selection could also favour altruistic behaviour, and morality as well. Indeed, as humans evolved better and better in building and using tools, they also became better at killing each other. It is a logical necessity that evolution could only favour those who knew how to use tools, but not against one's own people.  The Bible reveals quite nicely that the morality of the early Jews was not beyond this. A simple set of rules to hold the people together, under one god. Their god did not care much about people of other nations.  At the time of the NT, things were quite different - the Jews were under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simply ignore the Gentiles. A new situation required a new morality, and along with it a new religion was born. (A mutation in a meme pool.)  : Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what : difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or : otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only : way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the : objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it : - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer : that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries : no weight in any ""absolute"" sense.  It looks like you haven't bothered to read philosophy. Whenever there is an observer, there is a subjective point of view, which may value its existence and happiness (even if that were just a result of some physical event), and other's happiness, too, if the observer comes to think about it. In an absolutely objective sense, that is, without any observers or subjects, moral judgments lose their meaning.  It is not possible for a value to simply exist without a point of view. This includes gods, too, their values are only _their_ personal judgments, not absolute truths, since such truths do not exist.  The fact that most people do not deliberately want to hurt others is a manifestation of the way we have fought for our existence by becoming social beings who can think and value others' existence.  Morality is not property of humans alone - chimps, dolphins and many other species show great care for each other. Dolphins have sometimes saved humans from drowning, a good deed indeed.  : That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God : or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your : nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled : with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your : objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been : conditioned; there is no ""truth"" content. The whole of your : intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality.  The last statement does not logically follow. In fact, there is every reason to believe our thoughts can model reality very well, and our senses can convey reliable information. Solipsism is still a logical possibility, but not a very likely one.  You are continuously mixing two different views: the subjective point of view (which we all share) and an objective point of view, _which does not exist_. Any observer or thinker, any personal being, has its own point of view. It does not matter whether this point of view is a result of some physical events or not, it does not cease to be subjective.  From a non-observers non-point of view, values do not exist. Neither does pain, or pleasure, or beauty, or love. Such things are inherently subjective.  Once again, if god wants wives to submit to their husbands, or even to make a leap of faith into the unknown, or wants to punish us if we don't, I disagree with his morals. I do not think my morals come from any supreme being - to remove my morals means the same than to make me a zombie, a machine without a single thought. If god gave us morality to judge, but I disagree with him, it is not my fault. He is free to replace my morals. I cannot see what is the point of giving someone a moral system which disagrees with one's own and then to get mad at this.  God must be schizophrenic.  : All of this being so, you have excluded : yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, : etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no : weight whatsoever.  Neither can the opinion of any god, for that matter. I cannot understand why a subjective opinion of a thing made of matter is in any way less credible than an opinion of a thing made of something else.  Bill, take note: Absolute values must be independent of _any_ being, _including_ gods. If god has a subjective viewpoint, it is his own point of view, and his morals are his own.

Do you mean by ""omnipotent"" that God should be able to do anything/everything?  This creates a self-contradictory definition of omnipotence which is effectively useless.  To be descriptive, omnipotence must mean ""being all-powerful"" and not ""being able to do anything/everything"".  Let me illustrate by analogy. Suppose the United States were the only nuclear power on earth.  Suppose further that the US military could not effectively be countered by any nation or group of nations.  The US has the power to go into any country at any time for any reason to straighten things out as the leaders of the US see fit.  The US would be militarily ""omnipotent"".  But suppose further that the US holds to a doctrine/philosophy of not interfering in the internal affairs of any nation, such as the current civil war in the former Yugoslavian states.  Technically (in this scenario) the US would have the power to unilaterally go into Yugoslavia and straighten out the mess.  But effectively the US could not intervene without violating its own policy of non-interference.  If the policy of non-interference were held to strongly enough, then there would never be a question that it would ever be violated.  Effectively, the US would be limited in what it could actually do, although it had the power to do ""whatever it wanted"". The US would simply ""never want to interfere"" for such an idea would be beyond the consideration of its leaders given such an inviolate non-interference policy.  God is effectively limited in the same sense.  He is all powerful, but He cannot use His power in a way that would violate the essence of what He, Himself is.  I hope this helps to clear up some of the misunderstanding concerning omnipotence.  Regards,  Jim B. "

Everything may be clean, but it's evil for the person who eats it in an offensive spirit. Better not to eat the meat or drink the wine or whatever else your brother is offended by. As for the faith that you have, keep that between yourself and God. The person is in luck who doesn't condemn himself for what he samples. On the other hand, the person with doubts about something who eats it anyway is guilty, because he isn't acting on his faith, and any failure to act on faith is a sin.  [As far as I know, Christians (except specific Jewish Christian groups, and maybe some of the sabbatarians -- both of which are very small groups) do not practice circumcision on religious grounds.  In some countries it has been done for supposed health reasons, but I've not heard it argued that it is being done because of the Biblical commandment.  --clh] "

You see, >to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is, >we shall be moral unto what end?  The oft-quoted line that says people should be guaranteed life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness as inalienable rights, is a complete lie and deception, as the very authors of that line were in the process of proving.  Liberty is never free, it is always purchased at some cost, almost always at the cost to another.  Whos liberty is more inalienable? Similarly for right of life.  When one person must die if he is to save another, or even a group of others, whos life is more inalienable? That leads into the classic question of the value of the death penalty, especially for serial killers.  Whos life and liberty is more valuable, the serial killer, or the victim?  According to that beautiful line, those two rights should be completely inviolate, that is, noone should be able to remove them.  This _includes_ government.  Admittedly the serial killer has restricted some people's life and/or liberty, but is not his own life/liberty inviolate also?  According to the declaration of independence, it is.  >>>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.  And, I thought I had >>>defined murder as an intentional killing of a non-murderer, against his will.  Oooh, I like that.

That's *your* *interpretation* of these texts.  > They are 2 Peter 1:20-21, 2 Timothy 3:16-17, and > Galatians 1:11-12.  2 Peter 1:20-21 But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation, for no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.  The study notes in my Bible offer three possible meanings for verse 20. Apparantly it's not as clear to Charles Ryrie as it is to you.  2 Timothy 3:16-17 All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness; that the man of God may be adequate, equipped for every good work.  Galations 1:11-12 For I would have you know, brethren, that the gospel which was preached by me is not according to man.  For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but I receieved it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.  When I read these passages, it was not immediately clear to me what every phrase meant.  I had stop and think about the possible connotations of words, what the intent of the author may have been, wonder if the translator used the correct English word to convey the same meaning: I had to interpret.  If you want to believe that your are not interpreting Scripture as you read, there's probably nothing I can say to change your mind.  But I think it's naive to think that our culture, experiences, education, do not affect everything we read.  > Also, based on the fact that Jesus is the Word incarnate and he judges > people if they follow him (see Acts 17:29-31 and John 5:21-27) and that > those who reject Jesus' teachings are judged by the very words he spoke > (see John 12:47-50), then Jesus' words are true and do not need > interpretation, nor would it be just of God to judge based on his word > if it had to be interpreted.  In college, I took an entire course in Biblical interpretation.  Go to any Christian bookstore, there are scores of books on interpreting and understanding Scripture.

These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT introduction...  Two other Intros to consider:  The ""Introduction"" by Ku:mmel is a translation of a strandard NT text. The references are slightly dated and the style is somewhat dense, but the book contains a wealth of information.  Perrin and Duling's Intro is also very good.  It's somewhat more modern than Ku:mmel's but not quite so densely packed.  Also the authors tend to go through the books of the NT in the historical order of composition; this gives a very useful perspective on the development of the NT.  ... There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  ... Probably the best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  A slight dissent: I think the Harper's is ""OK"" but not great.  One particular problem I have is that it tends to be pretty skimpy on bibliographic material.  My feeling is that it is OK for quick look-ups, but not real useful for study in depth (e.g. I keep a copy in my office at work).  ... (I think there may be a couple of books with this title...  So far as I know there is the only one book with this exact title (James L Mays, general editor, Harper and ROw, 1988) although I think I recall a (older) series under the name ""Harper Commentaries"".  Also there's a separate Harper's Bible Dictionary (most of my comments on the HC also apply to the HBD.)  My favorite one-volume commentary is the ""New Jerome Biblical Commentary"".  The NJBC is rather Catholic in focus and somewhat biased towards the NT.  (The reader can decide for her- or himself whether these are pluses or minuses.)  In any case the scholarship is by and large excellent.  NOTE: The NJBC is a completely reworked, updated version of the ""Jerome Biblical Commentary"", copies of which can still be found on sale.

The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says; it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving commands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the probe starts a 'search for Earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish communications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows that we haven't forgotten about it.

Without delving into a deep discussion of >creationism vs evolutionism,  Here's the (main) problem. The scenario you outline is reasonably consistent, but all the evidence that I am familiar with not only does not support it, but indicates something far different. The Earth, by latest estimates, is about 4.6 billion years old, and has had life for about 3.5 billion of those years. Humans have only been around for (at most) about 200,000 years. But, the fossil evidence inidcates that life has been changing and evolving, and, in fact, disease-ridden, long before there were people. (Yes, there are fossils that show signs of disease... mostly bone disorders, of course, but there are some.) Heck, not just fossil evidence, but what we've been able to glean from genetic study shows that disease has been around for a long, long time. If human sin was what brought about disease (at least, indirectly, though necessarily) then how could it exist before humans?  >                             God created the original genetic code >perfect and without flaw.

Although the forces of >natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the >degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  Uh... I know of many evolutionary biologists, who know more about biology than you claim to, who will strongly disagree with this. There is no evidence that the human genetic code (or any other) 'started off' in perfect condition. It seems to adapt to its envionment, in a collective sense. I'm really curious as to what you mean by 'the degeneration of the genetic code'.  >Human DNA, being more ""complex"", tends to accumulate errors adversely >affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the >simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in >causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Umm. Nah, we seem to do a pretty good job of adapting to viruses and bacteria, and they to us. Only a very small percentage of microlife is harmful to humans... and that small percentage seems to be reasonalby constant in size, but the ranks keep changing. For example, bubonic plague used to be a really nasty disease, I'm sure you'll agree. But it still pops up from time to time, even today... and doesn't do as much damage. Part of that is because of better sanitation, but even when people get the disease, the symptoms tend to be less severe than in the past. This seems to be partly because people who were very susceptible died off long ago, and because the really nasty variants 'overgrazed', (forgive the poor terminology, I'm an engineer, not a doctor! :-> ) and died off for lack of nearby hosts. I could be wrong on this, but from what I gather acne is only a few hundred years old, and used to be nastier, though no killer. It seems to be getting less nasty w/age...  >                                                          Hence >we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial >diseases/disorders.  Now, wait a minute. I have a question. Humans were created perfect, right? And, you admit that we have an inbuilt abiliy to fight off disease. It seems unlikely that Satan, who's making the diseases, would also gift humans with the means to fight them off. Simpler to make the diseases less lethal, if he wants survivors. As far as I can see, our immune systems, imperfect though they may (presently?) be, must have been built into us by God. I want to be clear on this: are you saying that God was planning ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by building an immune system that was not, at the time of design, necessary? That is, God made our immune systems ahead of time, knowing that Adam and Eve would sin and their descendents would need to fight off diseases?  >This may be more of a mystical/supernatural explanation than you >are prepared to accept, but God is not responsible for disease. >Even if Satan had nothing to do with the original inception of >disease, evolution by random chance would have produced them since >humanity forsook God's protection.  Here's another puzzle. What, exactly, do you mean by 'perfect' in the phrase, 'created... perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect' system would be incapable of degrading over time. A 'perfect' system that will, without constant intervention, become imperfect is *not* a perfect system. At least, IMHO. Or is it that God did something like writing a masterpiece novel on a bunch of gum wrappers held together with Elmer's glue? That is, the original genetic 'instructions' were perfect, but were 'written' in inferior materials that had to be carefully tended or would fall apart? If so, why could God not have used better materials? Was God *incapable* of creating a system that could maintain itself, of did It just choose not to?  [deletions] >In summary, newborns are innocent, but God does not cause their suffering.  My main point, as I said, was that there really isn't any evidence for the explanation you give.

The Proton has been used in 2, 3, and 4 stage versions.  The two stage version was used for the first 3 launches, while the 3 and 4 stage versions are used today.  The four stage version is used mostly for escape (and geosynchronous?) orbits, while the 3 stage version is used for low earth orbits.

(Take a few >seconds and honestly ponder that thought and it's implications!!!)  I have thought about the implications, and it is scary.  We have a whole generation of families broken up because some men have decided that is is okay to leave their wives and children for the thrill of a younger, more attractive woman.  If we accept that it is legitimate for Jane to have divorced, how can we not accept anyone's decision to divorce because he has found someone with whom he can have a more ""deep, committed relationship.""  Marriage is not a state of being, it is a mutual journey in life. Love is not a passive feeling, it must be actively willed.  Is it acceptable for an older executive to dump his wife of many years who stayed home to care for the children because he can't be happy sexually unless he is with a beautiful young blonde?  The real solution for both in the couple to make a renewed effort.  Hold fast to the faith.  Has not the Lord repeatedly compared His relation to His people as a faithful and enduring husband?  We learn something very deep and very mystical when we marry and remain faithful through times of trial.  My spouse has a brain tumor that has left her partially paralyzed. If it were to resume growing (it is in remission, thanks be to God!) then perhaps the time would come when we could not have sexual relations.  That's life...the Lord would certainly not give me permission to seek someone else to satisfy my ""needs.""  The idea that it is alright to divorce if a couple ""grows apart"" seems to me to lead to such a monstrous destruction of the meaning of marriage that I feel we must make every effort to avoid any hint of compromise.  We have become so petty and small-minded that some husbands are threatening to divorce their wives unless the wives lose weight!  I praise the Lord for guiding me to marry my wife.  She married me anyway despite the possibility that I could have a terrible illness. And it turned out that she was the one with the brain tumor, but had I known I wouldn't have cared either.  And maybe I'll be in a car accident tomorrow and become paralyzed from the neck down. A married couple should deal with these situations with the help of the Lord, not divorce and run away from them.

You might start with Mack's book on Q and then examine the others afterward.  However I think that once you do that you will see that your ""evidence"" is not as sturdy as you'd like.

Whilst I have tried to be as neutral as possible regarding contentious issues, you should always remember that this document represents only one viewpoint.  I would encourage you to read widely and draw your own conclusions; some relevant books are listed in a companion article.  To provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have presented this article as an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the questions asked by the imaginary theist are questions which have been cropped up repeatedly on alt.atheism since the newsgroup was created.  Some other frequently asked questions are answered in a companion article.  Please note that this article is arguably slanted towards answering questions posed from a Christian viewpoint.  This is because the FAQ files reflect questions which have actually been asked, and it is predominantly Christians who proselytize on alt.atheism.  So when I talk of religion, I am talking primarily about religions such as Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine being.  Much of the discussion will apply to other religions, but some of it may not.  ""What is atheism?""  Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong atheism"".  It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  ""Weak atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  ""Strong atheism"" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".  Some atheists believe in the non-existence of all Gods; others limit their atheism to specific Gods, such as the Christian God, rather than making flat-out denials.  ""But isn't disbelieving in God the same thing as believing he doesn't exist?""  Definitely not.  Disbelief in a proposition means that one does not believe it to be true.  Not believing that something is true is not equivalent to believing that it is false; one may simply have no idea whether it is true or not.  Which brings us to agnosticism.  ""What is agnosticism then?""  The term 'agnosticism' was coined by Professor Huxley at a meeting of the Metaphysical Society in 1876.  He defined an agnostic as someone who disclaimed (""strong"") atheism and believed that the ultimate origin of things must be some cause unknown and unknowable.  Thus an agnostic is someone who believes that we do not and cannot know for sure whether God exists.  Words are slippery things, and language is inexact.  Beware of assuming that you can work out someone's philosophical point of view simply from the fact that she calls herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people use agnosticism to mean ""weak atheism"", and use the word ""atheism"" only when referring to ""strong atheism"".  Beware also that because the word ""atheist"" has so many shades of meaning, it is very difficult to generalize about atheists.  About all you can say for sure is that atheists don't believe in God.  For example, it certainly isn't the case that all atheists believe that science is the best way to find out about the universe.  ""So what is the philosophical justification or basis for atheism?""  There are many philosophical justifications for atheism.  To find out why a particular person chooses to be an atheist, it's best to ask her.  Many atheists feel that the idea of God as presented by the major religions is essentially self-contradictory, and that it is logically impossible that such a God could exist.  Others are atheists through scepticism, because they see no evidence that God exists.  ""But isn't it impossible to prove the non-existence of something?""  There are many counter-examples to such a statement.  For example, it is quite simple to prove that there does not exist a prime number larger than all other prime numbers.  Of course, this deals with well-defined objects obeying well-defined rules.  Whether Gods or universes are similarly well-defined is a matter for debate.  However, assuming for the moment that the existence of a God is not provably impossible, there are still subtle reasons for assuming the non-existence of God.  If we assume that something does not exist, it is always possible to show that this assumption is invalid by finding a single counter-example.  If on the other hand we assume that something does exist, and if the thing in question is not provably impossible, showing that the assumption is invalid may require an exhaustive search of all possible places where such a thing might be found, to show that it isn't there.  Such an exhaustive search is often impractical or impossible.  There is no such problem with largest primes, because we can prove that they don't exist.  Therefore it is generally accepted that we must assume things do not exist unless we have evidence that they do.  Even theists follow this rule most of the time; they don't believe in unicorns, even though they can't conclusively prove that no unicorns exist anywhere.  To assume that God exists is to make an assumption which probably cannot be tested.  We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to prove that he doesn't exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assumes by default that God does not exist, since that is an assumption we can test.  Those who profess strong atheism usually do not claim that no sort of God exists; instead, they generally restrict their claims so as to cover varieties of God described by followers of various religions.  So whilst it may be impossible to prove conclusively that no God exists, it may be possible to prove that (say) a God as described by a particular religious book does not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God described by any present-day religion exists.  In practice, believing that no God described by any religion exists is very close to believing that no God exists.  However, it is sufficiently different that counter-arguments based on the impossibility of disproving every kind of God are not really applicable.  ""But what if God is essentially non-detectable?""  If God interacts with our universe in any way, the effects of his interaction must be measurable.  Hence his interaction with our universe must be detectable.  If God is essentially non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he does not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheists would argue that if God does not interact with our universe at all, it is of no importance whether he exists or not.  If the Bible is to be believed, God was easily detectable by the Israelites. Surely he should still be detectable today?  Note that I am not demanding that God interact in a scientifically verifiable, physical way.  It must surely be possible to perceive some effect caused by his presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him from all the other things that don't exist?  ""OK, you may think there's a philosophical justification for atheism, but isn't it still a religious belief?""  One of the most common pastimes in philosophical discussion is ""the redefinition game"".  The cynical view of this game is as follows:  Person A begins by making a contentious statement.  When person B points out that it can't be true, person A gradually re-defines the words he used in the statement until he arrives at something person B is prepared to accept.  He then records the statement, along with the fact that person B has agreed to it, and continues.  Eventually A uses the statement as an ""agreed fact"", but uses his original definitions of all the words in it rather than the obscure redefinitions originally needed to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen to be apparently inconsistent, B will tend to play along.  The point of this digression is that the answer to the question ""Isn't atheism a religious belief?"" depends crucially upon what is meant by ""religious"".  ""Religion"" is generally characterized by belief in a superhuman controlling power -- especially in some sort of God -- and by faith and worship.  [ It's worth pointing out in passing that some varieties of Buddhism are not ""religion"" according to such a definition. ]  Atheism is certainly not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor is it categorized by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widening the definition of ""religious"" to encompass atheism tends to result in many other aspects of human behaviour suddenly becoming classed as ""religious"" as well -- such as science, politics, and watching TV.  ""OK, so it's not a religion.  But surely belief in atheism (or science) is still just an act of faith, like religion is?""  Firstly, it's not entirely clear that sceptical atheism is something one actually believes in.  Secondly, it is necessary to adopt a number of core beliefs or assumptions to make some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheists try to adopt as few core beliefs as possible; and even those are subject to questioning if experience throws them into doubt.  Science has a number of core assumptions.  For example, it is generally assumed that the laws of physics are the same for all observers.  These are the sort of core assumptions atheists make.  If such basic ideas are called ""acts of faith"", then almost everything we know must be said to be based on acts of faith, and the term loses its meaning.  Faith is more often used to refer to complete, certain belief in something. According to such a definition, atheism and science are certainly not acts of faith.  Of course, individual atheists or scientists can be as dogmatic as religious followers when claiming that something is ""certain"".  This is not a general tendency, however; there are many atheists who would be reluctant to state with certainty that the universe exists.  Faith is also used to refer to belief without supporting evidence or proof. Sceptical atheism certainly doesn't fit that definition, as sceptical atheism has no beliefs.  Strong atheism is closer, but still doesn't really match, as even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or the lack of it) when asserting that God does not exist.  ""If atheism is not religious, surely it's anti-religious?""  It is an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone as either ""for"" or ""against"", ""friend"" or ""enemy"".  The truth is not so clear-cut.  Atheism is the position that runs logically counter to theism; in that sense, it can be said to be ""anti-religion"".  However, when religious believers speak of atheists being ""anti-religious"" they usually mean that the atheists have some sort of antipathy or hatred towards theists.  This categorization of atheists as hostile towards religion is quite unfair. Atheist attitudes towards theists in fact cover a broad spectrum.  Most atheists take a ""live and let live"" attitude.  Unless questioned, they will not usually mention their atheism, except perhaps to close friends.  Of course, this may be in part because atheism is not ""socially acceptable"" in many countries.  A few atheists are quite anti-religious, and may even try to ""convert"" others when possible.  Historically, such anti-religious atheists have made little impact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countries.  (To digress slightly: the Soviet Union was originally dedicated to separation of church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizens were legally free to worship as they wished.  The institution of ""state atheism"" came about when Stalin took control of the Soviet Union and tried to destroy the churches in order to gain complete power over the population.)  Some atheists are quite vocal about their beliefs, but only where they see religion encroaching on matters which are not its business -- for example, the government of the USA.  Such individuals are usually concerned that church and state should remain separate.  ""But if you don't allow religion to have a say in the running of the state, surely that's the same as state atheism?""  The principle of the separation of church and state is that the state shall not legislate concerning matters of religious belief.  In particular, it means not only that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of another, but also that it cannot promote any belief which is religious in nature.  Religions can still have a say in discussion of purely secular matters.  For example, religious believers have historically been responsible for encouraging many political reforms.  Even today, many organizations campaigning for an increase in spending on foreign aid are founded as religious campaigns.  So long as they campaign concerning secular matters, and so long as they do not discriminate on religious grounds, most atheists are quite happy to see them have their say.  ""What about prayer in schools? If there's no God, why do you care if people pray?""  Because people who do pray are voters and lawmakers, and tend to do things that those who don't pray can't just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in schools is intimidating to non-Christians, even if they are told that they need not join in.  The diversity of religious and non-religious belief means that it is impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be acceptable to all those present at any public event.  Also, non-prayers tend to have friends and family who pray.  It is reasonable to care about friends and family wasting their time, even without other motives.  ""You mentioned Christians who campaign for increased foreign aid.  What about atheists?  Why aren't there any atheist charities or hospitals?  Don't atheists object to the religious charities?""  There are many charities without religious purpose that atheists can contribute to.  Some atheists contribute to religious charities as well, for the sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheists even do voluntary work for charities founded on a theistic basis.  Most atheists seem to feel that atheism isn't worth shouting about in connection with charity.  To them, atheism is just a simple, obvious everyday matter, and so is charity.  Many feel that it's somewhat cheap, not to say self-righteous, to use simple charity as an excuse to plug a particular set of religious beliefs.  To ""weak"" atheists, building a hospital to say ""I do not believe in God"" is a rather strange idea; it's rather like holding a party to say ""Today is not my birthday"".  Why the fuss?  Atheism is rarely evangelical.  ""You said atheism isn't anti-religious.  But is it perhaps a backlash against one's upbringing, a way of rebelling?""  Perhaps it is, for some.  But many people have parents who do not attempt to force any religious (or atheist) ideas upon them, and many of those people choose to call themselves atheists.  It's also doubtless the case that some religious people chose religion as a backlash against an atheist upbringing, as a way of being different.  On the other hand, many people choose religion as a way of conforming to the expectations of others.  On the whole, we can't conclude much about whether atheism or religion are backlash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go along with a group rather than act or think independently.  ""How do atheists differ from religious people?""  They don't believe in God.  That's all there is to it.  Atheists may listen to heavy metal -- backwards, even -- or they may prefer a Verdi Requiem, even if they know the words.  They may wear Hawaiian shirts, they may dress all in black, they may even wear orange robes.  (Many Buddhists lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheists even carry a copy of the Bible around -- for arguing against, of course!  Whoever you are, the chances are you have met several atheists without realising it.  Atheists are usually unexceptional in behaviour and appearance.  ""Unexceptional? But aren't atheists less moral than religious people?""  That depends.  If you define morality as obedience to God, then of course atheists are less moral as they don't obey any God.  But usually when one talks of morality, one talks of what is acceptable (""right"") and unacceptable (""wrong"") behaviour within society.  Humans are social animals, and to be maximally successful they must co-operate with each other.  This is a good enough reason to discourage most atheists from ""anti-social"" or ""immoral"" behaviour, purely for the purposes of self-preservation.  Many atheists behave in a ""moral"" or ""compassionate"" way simply because they feel a natural tendency to empathize with other humans.  So why do they care what happens to others?  They don't know, they simply are that way.  Naturally, there are some people who behave ""immorally"" and try to use atheism to justify their actions.  However, there are equally many people who behave ""immorally"" and then try to use religious beliefs to justify their actions.  For example:  ""Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners...  But for that very reason, I was shown mercy so that in me...  Jesus Christ might display His unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe in him and receive eternal life.  Now to the king eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever.""  The above quote is from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992 by Jeffrey Dahmer, the notorious cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  It seems that for every atheist mass-murderer, there is a religious mass-murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?  A survey conducted by the Roper Organization found that behavior deteriorated after ""born again"" experiences.  While only 4% of respondents said they had driven intoxicated before being ""born again,"" 12% had done so after conversion.  Similarly, 5% had used illegal drugs before conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitted to engaging in illicit sex before salvation; 5% after. [""Freethought Today"", September 1991, p. 12.]  So it seems that at best, religion does not have a monopoly on moral behaviour.  ""Is there such a thing as atheist morality?""  If you mean ""Is there such a thing as morality for atheists?"", then the answer is yes, as explained above.  Many atheists have ideas about morality which are at least as strong as those held by religious people.  If you mean ""Does atheism have a characteristic moral code?"", then the answer is no.  Atheism by itself does not imply anything much about how a person will behave.  Most atheists follow many of the same ""moral rules"" as theists, but for different reasons.  Atheists view morality as something created by humans, according to the way humans feel the world 'ought' to work, rather than seeing it as a set of rules decreed by a supernatural being.  ""Then aren't atheists just theists who are denying God?""  A study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the atheists who responded became atheists because religion did not work for them.  They had found that religious beliefs were fundamentally incompatible with what they observed around them.  Atheists are not unbelievers through ignorance or denial; they are unbelievers through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time studying one or more religions, sometimes in very great depth.  They have made a careful and considered decision to reject religious beliefs.  This decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that individual's personality.  For a naturally sceptical person, the choice of atheism is often the only one that makes sense, and hence the only choice that person can honestly make.  ""But don't atheists want to believe in God?""  Atheists live their lives as though there is nobody watching over them.  Many of them have no desire to be watched over, no matter how good-natured the ""Big Brother"" figure might be.  Some atheists would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should one believe things merely because one wants them to be true?  The risks of such an approach should be obvious.  Atheists often decide that wanting to believe something is not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.  ""But of course atheists see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are unwilling in their souls to see!""  Many, if not most atheists were previously religious.  As has been explained above, the vast majority have seriously considered the possibility that God exists.  Many atheists have spent time in prayer trying to reach God.  Of course, it is true that some atheists lack an open mind; but assuming that all atheists are biased and insincere is offensive and closed-minded. Comments such as ""Of course God is there, you just aren't looking properly"" are likely to be viewed as patronizing.  Certainly, if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheists it is vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are being sincere if they say that they have searched for God.  If you are not willing to believe that they are basically telling the truth, debate is futile.  ""Isn't the whole of life completely pointless to an atheist?""  Many atheists live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think gives meaning to life, and they pursue those goals.  They try to make their lives count, not by wishing for eternal life, but by having an influence on other people who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate his life to political reform, in the hope of leaving his mark on history.  It is a natural human tendency to look for ""meaning"" or ""purpose"" in random events.  However, it is by no means obvious that ""life"" is the sort of thing that has a ""meaning"".  To put it another way, not everything which looks like a question is actually a sensible thing to ask.  Some atheists believe that asking ""What is the meaning of life?"" is as silly as asking ""What is the meaning of a cup of coffee?"".  They believe that life has no purpose or meaning, it just is.  ""So how do atheists find comfort in time of danger?""  There are many ways of obtaining comfort; from family, friends, or even pets. Or on a less spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.  That may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so what?  Should individuals believe in things because they are comforting, or should they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?  In the end, it's a decision for the individual concerned.  Most atheists are unable to believe something they would not otherwise believe merely because it makes them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider that if searching for truth sometimes makes them feel unhappy, that's just hard luck.  ""Don't atheists worry that they might suddenly be shown to be wrong?""  The short answer is ""No, do you?""  Many atheists have been atheists for years.  They have encountered many arguments and much supposed evidence for the existence of God, but they have found all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.  Thousands of years of religious belief haven't resulted in any good proof of the existence of God.  Atheists therefore tend to feel that they are unlikely to be proved wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worrying about it.  ""So why should theists question their beliefs? Don't the same arguments apply?""  No, because the beliefs being questioned are not similar.  Weak atheism is the sceptical ""default position"" to take; it asserts nothing.  Strong atheism is a negative belief.  Theism is a very strong positive belief.  Atheists sometimes also argue that theists should question their beliefs because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believers, but to everyone else.  ""What sort of harm?""  Religion represents a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It's not just a matter of religious believers wasting their money on church buildings; think of all the time and effort spent building churches, praying, and so on. Imagine how that effort could be better spent.  Many theists believe in miracle healing.  There have been plenty of instances of ill people being ""healed"" by a priest, ceasing to take the medicines prescribed to them by doctors, and dying as a result.  Some theists have died because they have refused blood transfusions on religious grounds.  It is arguable that the Catholic Church's opposition to birth control -- and condoms in particular -- is increasing the problem of overpopulation in many third-world countries and contributing to the spread of AIDS world-wide.  Religious believers have been known to murder their children rather than allow their children to become atheists or marry someone of a different religion.  ""Those weren't REAL believers.  They just claimed to be believers as some sort of excuse.""  What makes a real believer?  There are so many One True Religions it's hard to tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many competing groups, all convinced that they are the only true Christians.  Sometimes they even fight and kill each other.  How is an atheist supposed to decide who's a REAL Christian and who isn't, when even the major Christian churches like the Catholic Church and the Church of England can't decide amongst themselves?  In the end, most atheists take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who calls himself a Christian, and uses Christian belief or dogma to justify his actions, should be considered a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christians are just perverting Christian teaching for their own ends -- but surely if the Bible can be so readily used to support un-Christian acts it can't be much of a moral code? If the Bible is the word of God, why couldn't he have made it less easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your beliefs aren't a perversion of what your God intended?  If there is no single unambiguous interpretation of the Bible, then why should an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so? Sorry, but if someone claims that he believes in Jesus and that he murdered others because Jesus and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a Christian.  ""Obviously those extreme sorts of beliefs should be questioned.  But since nobody has ever proved that God does not exist, it must be very unlikely that more basic religious beliefs, shared by all faiths, are nonsense.""  That does not hold, because as was pointed out at the start of this dialogue, positive assertions concerning the existence of entities are inherently much harder to disprove than negative ones.  Nobody has ever proved that unicorns don't exist, but that doesn't make it unlikely that they are myths.  It is therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than it is to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, ""weak"" atheists would argue that asserting nothing is better still.  ""Well, if atheism's so great, why are there so many theists?""  Unfortunately, the popularity of a belief has little to do with how ""correct"" it is, or whether it ""works""; consider how many people believe in astrology, graphology, and other pseudo-sciences.  Many atheists feel that it is simply a human weakness to want to believe in gods.  Certainly in many primitive human societies, religion allows the people to deal with phenomena that they do not adequately understand.  Of course, there's more to religion than that.  In the industrialized world, we find people believing in religious explanations of phenomena even when there are perfectly adequate natural explanations.  Religion may have started as a means of attempting to explain the world, but nowadays it serves other purposes as well.  ""But so many cultures have developed religions.  Surely that must say something?""  Not really.  Most religions are only superficially similar; for example, it's worth remembering that religions such as Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of concept of God in the Christian sense.  Of course, most religions are quick to denounce competing religions, so it's rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.  ""What about all the famous scientists and philosophers who have concluded that God exists?""  For every scientist or philosopher who believes in a god, there is one who does not.  Besides, as has already been pointed out, the truth of a belief is not determined by how many people believe it.  Also, it is important to realize that atheists do not view famous scientists or philosophers in the same way that theists view their religious leaders.  A famous scientist is only human; she may be an expert in some fields, but when she talks about other matters her words carry no special weight.  Many respected scientists have made themselves look foolish by speaking on subjects which lie outside their fields of expertise.  ""So are you really saying that widespread belief in religion indicates nothing?""  Not entirely.  It certainly indicates that the religion in question has properties which have helped it so spread so far.  The theory of memetics talks of ""memes"" -- sets of ideas which can propagate themselves between human minds, by analogy with genes.  Some atheists view religions as sets of particularly successful parasitic memes, which spread by encouraging their hosts to convert others.  Some memes avoid destruction by discouraging believers from questioning doctrine, or by using peer pressure to keep one-time believers from admitting that they were mistaken.  Some religious memes even encourage their hosts to destroy hosts controlled by other memes.  Of course, in the memetic view there is no particular virtue associated with successful propagation of a meme.  Religion is not a good thing because of the number of people who believe it, any more than a disease is a good thing because of the number of people who have caught it.  ""Even if religion is not entirely true, at least it puts across important messages.  What are the fundamental messages of atheism?""  There are many important ideas atheists promote.  The following are just a few of them; don't be surprised to see ideas which are also present in some religions.  There is more to moral behaviour than mindlessly following rules.  Be especially sceptical of positive claims.  If you want your life to have some sort of meaning, it's up to you to find it.  Search for what is true, even if it makes you uncomfortable.  Make the most of your life, as it's probably the only one you'll have.  It's no good relying on some external power to change you; you must change yourself.  Just because something's popular doesn't mean it's good.  If you must assume something, assume something it's easy to test.  Don't believe things just because you want them to be true.  and finally (and most importantly):  All beliefs should be open to question.

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter.  You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions (when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching.  The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be done there........   |> |> They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads |> (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course |> any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the |> US at great cost.

The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill this idea.  -- H.D.

The basic problem with your argument is your total and complete reliance on the biblical text.  Luke's account is highly suspect (I would refer you to the hermeneia commentary on Acts).  Moreover Luke's account is written at least 90 years after the fact.  In the meantime everyone he mentions has died and attempts to find actual written sources behind the text have come up with only the we section of the later portion of acts as firmly established. Moreover, Pauls account of some of the events in Acts (as recorded in Galatians) fail to establish the acts accounts.  What we need, therefore, is a reliable text, critically appreciated, which documents the death of Christians for belief in the Resurrection.  I would suggest you look at some greek and roman historians.  I think you will be disapointed.  randy

DICK  Philip K. Dick Dick wrote many philosophical and thought-provoking short stories and novels.  His stories are bizarre at times, but very approachable. He wrote mainly SF, but he wrote about people, truth and religion rather than technology.  Although he often believed that he had met some sort of God, he remained sceptical.  Amongst his novels, the following are of some relevance:  ""Galactic Pot-Healer"" A fallible alien deity summons a group of Earth craftsmen and women to a remote planet to raise a giant cathedral from beneath the oceans.  When the deity begins to demand faith from the earthers, pot-healer Joe Fernwright is unable to comply.  A polished, ironic and amusing novel.  ""A Maze of Death"" Noteworthy for its description of a technology-based religion.  ""VALIS"" The schizophrenic hero searches for the hidden mysteries of Gnostic Christianity after reality is fired into his brain by a pink laser beam of unknown but possibly divine origin.  He is accompanied by his dogmatic and dismissively atheist friend and assorted other odd characters.  ""The Divine Invasion"" God invades Earth by making a young woman pregnant as she returns from another star system.  Unfortunately she is terminally ill, and must be assisted by a dead man whose brain is wired to 24-hour easy listening music.  MARGARET ATWOOD  ""The Handmaid's Tale"" A story based on the premise that the US Congress is mysteriously assassinated, and fundamentalists quickly take charge of the nation to set it ""right"" again.  The book is the diary of a woman's life as she tries to live under the new Christian theocracy.  Women's right to own property is revoked, and their bank accounts are closed; sinful luxuries are outlawed, and the radio is only used for readings from the Bible.  Crimes are punished retroactively: doctors who performed legal abortions in the ""old world"" are hunted down and hanged.  Atwood's writing style is difficult to get used to at first, but the tale grows more and more chilling as it goes on.  VARIOUS AUTHORS  ""The Bible"" This somewhat dull and rambling work has often been criticized.  However, it is probably worth reading, if only so that you'll know what all the fuss is about.

RICHARD SWINBURNE  ""The Existence of God (Revised Edition)"", Clarendon Paperbacks, Oxford This book is the second volume in a trilogy that began with ""The Coherence of Theism"" (1977) and was concluded with ""Faith and Reason"" (1981).  In this work, Swinburne attempts to construct a series of inductive arguments for the existence of God.  His arguments, which are somewhat tendentious and rely upon the imputation of late 20th century western Christian values and aesthetics to a God which is supposedly as simple as can be conceived, were decisively rejected in Mackie's ""The Miracle of Theism"".  In the revised edition of ""The Existence of God"", Swinburne includes an Appendix in which he makes a somewhat incoherent attempt to rebut Mackie.  J. L. MACKIE  ""The Miracle of Theism"", Oxford This (posthumous) volume contains a comprehensive review of the principal arguments for and against the existence of God.  It ranges from the classical philosophical positions of Descartes, Anselm, Berkeley, Hume et al, through the moral arguments of Newman, Kant and Sidgwick, to the recent restatements of the classical theses by Plantinga and Swinburne.  It also addresses those positions which push the concept of God beyond the realm of the rational, such as those of Kierkegaard, Kung and Philips, as well as ""replacements for God"" such as Lelie's axiarchism.  The book is a delight to read - less formalistic and better written than Martin's works, and refreshingly direct when compared with the hand-waving of Swinburne.  JAMES A.

And we're >thinking that this will work with high school kids?!?  I am told that Planned Parenthood/SIECUS-style ""values-free"" methods, that teach contraceptive technology and advise kids how to make ""choices"", actually _increase_ pregnancy rates. I posted a long article on this a while back and will be happy to email a copy to any who are interested.  The article included sources to contact for information on research verifying these statements, and an outstanding source for info on acquiring abstinence-related curricula even in single-copy quantities for home use.  The same research produced the results that abstinence-related curricula were found to _decrease_ pregnancy rates in teens.  I assume that it is reasonable to assume that the AIDS rate will fluctuate with the pregnancy rate.  The difference is not in ""contraceptive technology"" but in the values taught to the children.  The PP/SIECUS curricula taught the kids that they have legitimate choices, while the abstinence related curricula taught them that they did _not_ have _legitimate_ choices other than abstinence.  It is the values system that is the strongest determinent of the behavior behavior of these kids.  Despite the better track record of abstinence-related curricula, they are suppressed in favor of curricula that produce an effect contrary to that desired.  Question for further discussion (as they say in the textbooks):  Why don't we teach ""safe drug use"" to kids, instead of drug abstinence?  Isn't it because we know that a class in ""how to use drugs safely if you _choose_ to use drugs"" would increase drug use?  Why isn't ""drug abstinence education"" barred from schools because it teaches ""religion""?  Aren't we abandoning those children who will use drugs anyway, and need instruction in their safe use?   -- Joe Kellett jkellett@netcom.com "

I agree with what Darren has to say here, but would like to add a personal observation.  What I see as arrogance and the problem I have with it is not a sense of personal certainty, but a lack of respect for others who come to differing conclusions.  Clearly, this is not just Christian vs. Non-Christian; there is a whole spectrum of belief systems within Christianity.  I do not tend to argue with others about matters of personal faith because, like aesthetics, it is not demonstable by objective means.  Choosing what to believe and rely on are important areas of personal sovereignty.  What bothers me is when others suggest that, in these matters of faith, their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others.  It follows from this that God must give everyone the same revelation of truth, and thus anyone who comes to a different conclusion is intentionally choosing the wrong path.  This is the arrogance I see; a lack of respect for the honest conclusions of others on matters which are between them and God. Even a personal certainty leaves room for the beliefs of others.  It is universalizing those matters of personal faith, coupled by a proud notion that one's relationship with God is superior to other's, that leads to arrogance.  In my honest (and nonuniversal) opinion. :-)   >Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu >""At the core of all well-founded belief, lies belief that is unfounded."" >                                                    -- Ludwig Wittgenstein  comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu  [It is certainly reasonable to ask for some humility about our own ability to know the truth.  There are also different paths in some areas of practice.  But I'd like to see more clarification about what you mean when you reject the idea of saying ""their specific beliefs are not only true to them but are absolute and should be binding on others.""  If something is true, it is true for everyone, assuming that the belief is something about God, history, etc.  Of course something of the form ""I believe that it's best for me not to xxx"" could be true for some people and not others.  I have suggested in the past that God may be less concerned about doctrinal agreement than many people are.

They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes.

Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it.  >>Kinda funny isn't it that someone who talks about a problem like this is >>at a place where everything is overhead. > >When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that >integration isn't overhead.

What I completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.  There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this.  >>Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally >>demanded change that caused the problems? Methinks that you are being >>selective with the facts again. > >The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on >Congress. Suprise suprise.

This merely points out a >>blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see. > >You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for >resuply.

This many headed hydra that has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of your position.

Like about 2 million km^2 (if you think that sounds like a lot, it's only a few tens of m^2 per burger that said organization sold last year). You'd be best off with a reflective substance that could be sprayed thinly by an unmanned craft in lunar orbit (or, rather, a large set of such craft). If you can get a reasonable albedo it would be visible even at new moon (since the moon itself is quite dark), and _bright_ at full moon. You might have to abandon the colour, though.  Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit unmanned spraying craft, build 50 said craft, establish a lunar base to extract TiO2 (say: for colour you'd be better off with a sulphur compound, I suppose) and some sort of propellant, and Bob's your uncle.  I'll do it for, say, 20 billion dollars (plus changes of identity for me and all my loved ones). Delivery date 2010.  Can we get the fast-food chain bidding against the fizzy-drink vendors?

Instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had.  My reading of what Nick actually said is that ""people aren't required in all parts of all space processes"", so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program, I read as ""People are required in all parts of all space processes.""

I'd only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your job, Fred.

If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's no worse than your own.  Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical, while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might see it better, Fred.  ""Net.ghod wannabe""?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands. Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.  Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well, I just hope you're happy.

The article starts with ""A leader of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible."" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research ""is a real question for me."" O'Connor said ""everything is fair game,"" including ""dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry, chopping management of the space station program at some NASA facilities around the country, working closely with the Russian space station Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet.""  O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost.  The Post says O'Connor described the design derived from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor talked about how the White House wants three options, sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC, modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch Core [""wingless Orbiter""] @ JSC. Later, in response to a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say the option based on a SSF redesign was a ""moderate"" cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not the ""high cost"" option as Sawyer wrote).  The article goes on to describe the other two options as ""one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle - the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.""  The last sentence in the article contradicts the title & the first paragraph. The sentence reads ""He [O'Connor] said a streamlined version of the planned space station Freedom is still possible within the administration's budget guidelines.""  "

If something is true, it is true for everyone, assuming that >the belief is something about God, history, etc....  Yes, I agree.  What I'm trying to point out is that, in matters of faith (i.e. tenets which are not logically persuasive), one may be convinced of the truth of certain things through, for instance, personal revelation.  And its certainly fine to share that revelation or those beliefs with others.  And I don't think that its arrogant, persay, to accepts matters of pure faith as truth for oneself.  Where I think the conflict arises is in assuming that, where disagreements on beliefs arise, all others *must* have been given the same truth, and that God must reveal His truth to everyone in such a way that all would honestly agree.  I think this can lead to the conclusion that anyone who disagrees with you are being sinful or dishonest; that they are rejecting something they *know* to be truth because it is inconvenient for them, or because they wish to spurn God.  I would say that this is equivalent to assuming that *all* truths one holds are universal and absolute.  And the problem I see with this is that it negates the individuality of humans and their relationships with God.  This does not mean there is no absolute truth; just that some areas of doctrinal disagreement may be areas where God has not established or revealed that truth.  -- comments, criticism welcome... -Ken alvin@ucsu.colorado.edu  [I agree with you.  --clh] "

The facts are that less Iraqis died in the Gulf War than did civilians in any other war of comparable size this century!  This was due mostly to the short duration coupled with precise surgical bombing techniques which were technically possible only recently.  The idea that ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi citizens died is ludicrous.  Not even ""hundreds of thousands"" of Iraqi soldiers died, and they were the ones being targeted!  Or do you think that the US and its allies were specifically out to kill and maim Iraqi civilians? Either the smart bombs didn't hit their targets (and we know they did), or they were targeting civilian targets (!) which is hardly condusive to destroying Iraq's military potential.  The military mission planners are not fools, they know they have to hit *military* targets to win a war. Hitting civilian targets does nothing but unite the people against you, not a laudable goal if one wants the people to rise up against their tyrant-dictator. > > OK, so some innocent people died.

How about all the innocent people who died in blanket-bombing in WW2? I don't hear you bemoaning them!  War is never an exact science, but with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage of civilian casualties.  Sometimes mistakes are made; targets are misidentified; innocents die.  That's war the way it really is. But the alternative, to allow tyrannical dictators to treat the earth like it's one big rummage sale, grabbing everything they can get is worse.

You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I feel sure that was not your intent.  So the Iraqi war was wrong, eh?  I'm sure that appeasement would have worked better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I guess we shouldn't have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent German civilians killed in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor French who died in the crossfire because we invaded the continent?  We should have just let Hitler take over Europe, and you'd be speaking German instead of English right now.  Tyrants like Hussein *have* to be stopped.  His kind don't understand diplomacy; they only understand the point of a gun.  My only regret is that Bush wimped out and didn't have the military roll into Baghdad, so now Hussein is still in power and the Iraqi people's sacrifice (not to mention the 357 Americans who died) was for naught.  Liberating Kuwait was a good thing, but wiping Hussein off the map would've been better!  And as for poor, poor Rodney King!  Did you ever stop and think *why* the jury in the first trial brought back a verdict of ""not guilty""? Those who have been foaming at the mouth for the blood of those policemen certainly have looked no further than the video tape. But the jury looked at *all* the evidence, evidence which you and I have not seen.  When one makes a judgment without the benefit of a trial where evidence can be presented on both sides, one has simply lowered himself to the level of vigilante justice, a state-of-mind which your sarcasm above seemingly spoke against, but instead tends to support in the case against the policemen.  Law in this country is intended to protect the rights of the accused, whether they be criminals or cops.  One is not found guilty if there is a reasonable doubt of one's guilt, and only the jury is in a position to assess the evidence and render a verdict.  Anyone else is simply succumbing to verbal vigilantism.  Regards,  Jim B. "

I agree entirely.  Speaking as an atheist (heterosexual, for what it's worth), this is one of the least attractive parts of some varieties of Christianity.  Although I'm sure it's possible to argue theologically that we shouldn't make analogies between discrimination on the basis of sex and race and discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, morally the case looks unanswerable (for those outside religion): the three forms _are_ analogous; we shouldn't discriminate on the basis of sex, race or sexual orientation.  I found the moderator's FAQs on the subject instructive, and recommend everyone to read them.  There seem to be three different levels of acceptance:  1) Regard homosexual orientation as a sin (or evil, whatever) 2) Regard homosexual behaviour as a sin, but accept orientation (though presumably orientation is unfortunate) and dislike people who indulge 3) As 2, but ""love the sinner"" 4) Accept homosexuality altogether.  My experience is that 3 is the most common attitude (I imagine 1 and 2 are limited to a few fundamentalist sects).  I suppose I can go along with 3, except that I have this feeling that a 14--15 year old living in a community with this attitude, on discovering that they were more attracted to members of the same sex, would not feel the love of the community, but would rather feel the pressure not to exhibit their feelings.  I'm not saying that the community (in particular the parents) would not love the child, but I suspect the child would not feel loved. -- Bruce              CMSR, University of Liverpool "

Also, where in the Bible is there mention of Lucifer's free will? We make a big fuss about mankind having free will, but it strikes me as being an after-the-fact rationalisation, and in fact, like salvation, not one that all Christians believe in identically.

sci.space	" From: mcelwre@cnsvax.uwec.edu Subject: LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics Organization: University of Wisconsin Eau Claire Lines: 552    LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics  Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists CLAIM to be looking for a ""Unified Field Theory"" in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years!  The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he calls the ""Reciprocal System"", is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time:  (1) ""The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME.""  (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN.""  From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational- rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL DATUM"").  At each step in the development, Larson was able to MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY BURSTS).  And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter- atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of matter.  All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy complex mathematics, in his books.    BOOKS of Dewey B. Larson  The following is a complete list of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  Some of the early books are out of print now, but still available through inter-library loan.  ""The Structure of the Physical Universe"" (1959)  ""The Case AGAINST the Nuclear Atom"" (1963)  ""Beyond Newton"" (1964)  ""New Light on Space and Time"" (1965)  ""Quasars and Pulsars"" (1971)  ""NOTHING BUT MOTION"" (1979) [A $9.50 SUBSTITUTE for the $8.3 BILLION ""Super Collider"".] [The last four chapters EXPLAIN chemical bonding.]  ""The Neglected Facts of Science"" (1982)  ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" (1984) [FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL astrophysical mysteries.]  ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"" (1988)  All but the last of these books were published by North Pacific Publishers, P.O. Box 13255, Portland, OR  97213, and should be available via inter-library loan if your local university or public library doesn't have each of them.  Several of them, INCLUDING the last one, are available from: The International Society of Unified Science (ISUS), 1680 E. Atkin Ave., Salt Lake City, Utah  84106.  This is the organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory. They have other related publications, including the quarterly journal ""RECIPROCITY"".    Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background  Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE chemical properties based only on the elements used.  Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC..  Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so. He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER.  A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been IGNORING one for over 30 years now!  ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"", ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG.   Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to Minneapolis after retiring.    ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!  I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific"" value.  Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.) which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment.  A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW!  Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for this WASTED money?!   Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the ""Supercollider""?!   Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be named after a leading particle PHYSICIST.    LARSONIAN Anti-Matter  In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made, in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"".  In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each other.  In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our MATERIAL half.    LARSONIAN Relativity  The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"".  But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury.  Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.).  In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured from our material half of the physical universe.  The one dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing about this.]   In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS. The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL FANTASY).    THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION  I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 pages, indexed, hardcover.  It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago.  It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma- ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc..  It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with OPEN MINDS!  The following is an example of his Theory's success: In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he had an immediate related explanation for them also.    GAMMA-RAY BURSTS  Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of directional coincidence).  Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects, and come from all directions uniformly.)  I wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to stop it!  Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS!    LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation  About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them.  But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" and in some of his other books.  First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements.  When the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some of his books [better than I can].  When the star explodes, the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while.  Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R Diagram.  The chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space, making a single lone star again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY system, orbiting each other.  According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron stars"", ""black holes"", etc..    LARSONIAN Solar System Formation  If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS!  In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all this information, and other principles of his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive his own version of Bode's Law.    ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!  I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than the sum of the two original ""black holes"".  Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black holes"", etc.!  After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to ""prove"" their theory.   By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist Stephen Hawking.  The physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT!  I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of Unified Science).    ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION  I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed.  I found a possible clue about why they might work on pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe.  I quote one paragraph:  ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance. The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system.  All material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation. Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level.""  Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate). (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and ""below"" labels mixed up.]  Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass- LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of light!  If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the rotation of the particle.)  The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds.    SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics  The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"".  It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have.  Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars.  Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed.    For more information, answers to your questions, etc., please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS).

soc.religion.christian	" From: JEK@cu.nih.gov Subject: muslim tithe; sexism in Genesis 2 Lines: 33  According to mdbs@ms.uky.edu, muslims tithe 1/6 of their income.  Perhaps there are some offshoots of Islam that impose this on their followers.  But the standard tithe is 1/40 of one's net worth, once a year.  The same writer also objects to the Bible for teaching that  > ""woman was created after man, to be his helper"" etc.  This is presumably a reference to Genesis 2. Suppose that that chapter had been written with the sexes reversed. We have God creating woman, and then saying, ""It is not good that woman should be alone. I will make a help meet for her."" Feminists would be outraged. The clear implication would be that God had started at the bottom and worked up, making first the plants, then the fish and birds, then the beasts, then woman, and finally His masterpiece, the Male Chauvinist Pig. The statement that woman is not capable of functioning by herself, that she needs a man to open doors for her, would have been seen as a particularly gratuitous insult. The fact that the creation of woman from the dust of the ground was given only briefly and in general, while the creation of the Man was given in six times the number of words, would have been cited as evidence of the author's estimate of the relative importance of the sexes. The verdict would have been unequivocal. ""No self-respecting woman can accept this book as a moral guide, or as anything but sexist trash!"" I suggest that Moses, fearing this reaction, altered his original draft and described the creation with Adam first and then Eve, so as to appease Miriam and other radical feminists of the day.

I >think the usual analysis would be that sin is not part of the basic >definition of humanity.  It's a consequence of the fall.

It grew up in reaction to Nestorianism, which held that the Son and Jesus are two different people who happened to be united in the same body temporarily.  Monophysitism is held by the Copts of Egypt and Ethipoia and by the Jacobites of Syria and the Armenian Orthodox.  It believes that Jesus Christ was God (which is correct), that he was man (which is correct), that he was one person (which is correct), but that he had only one nature and one will and oen energy (which is heretical, the orthodox position is that he had two natures and two wills and two energies, both divine and human, though the wills were in perfect harmony).  That is what Mike is trying to get across, that while Jesus came in human form, Mike says He did not have a human nature or a human will.  In reality, he had both, though neither made him subject to original sin. It is interesting to note that the Monothelites were a reaction to this conflict and attempted to solve the problem by admitting two natures but not two wills or two energies.  It also was condemned, at a late council in Constantinople I believe.  Andy Byler  [These issues get mighty subtle.  When you see people saying different things it's often hard to tell whether they really mean seriously different things, or whether they are using different terminology.  I don't think there's any question that there is a problem with Nestorius, and I would agree that the saying Christ had a human form without a real human nature or will is heretical.  But I'd like to be a bit wary about the Copts, Armenians, etc.  Recent discussions suggest that their monophysite position may not be as far from orthodoxy as many had thought.  Nestorius was an extreme representative of one of the two major schools of thought.  More moderate representatives were regarded as orthodox, e.g. Theodore of Mopsuestia.  My impression is that the modern monophysite groups inherit the entire tradition, not just Nestorius' version, and that some of them may have a sufficient balanced position to be regarded as orthodox.  --clh] "

Basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the US, unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors.. ascially what I understand from talking to a few miner friends of mine, that they (the congress) propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine, versus the adjusted income, also the state governments have there normal taxes. So by the time you get done, paying for materials, workers, and other expenses you can owe more than what you made. BAsically if you make a 1000.00 and spend 500. ofor expenses, you can owe 600.00 in federal taxes.. Bascially it is driving the miners off the land.. And the only peopel who benefit are the eco-freaks..

sci.space	" From: Wales.Larrison@ofa123.fidonet.org Subject: Space Advertising (2 of 2) X-Sender: newtout 0.08 Feb 23 1993 Lines: 82  Two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a 20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from the Mir Space Station.  While this ""Banner"" reflector was blank, NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space- based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV commercial, as filmed from the Mir. The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the ""Environmental Billboard"".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ""Environmental Billboard"" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area, deployed by the inflatable 'frame'. To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ""ozone reading sensors"" to ""continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's delicate protective ozone layer,"" according to Mike Lawson, head of SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere. According to IMI, ""as the biodegradable material burns, it will release ozone-building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer."" The remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns up and ""adds to the ozone supply."" This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost $600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.  But back to Brian's questions: >And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN >news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild >idea"" stage or does it have real funding?  See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus $10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there. And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer, and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an idiot?) (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...) As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.  And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be my guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least I don't THINK I do...). ------------------------------------------------------------------- Wales Larrison                            Space Technology Investor  --- Maximus 2.01wb "

alt.atheism	" From: bobbe@vice.ICO.TEK.COM (Robert Beauchaine) Subject: Nostalgia Organization: Tektronix Inc., Beaverton, Or. Lines: 1049   The recent rise of nostalgia in this group, combined with the incredible level of utter bullshit, has prompted me to comb through my archives and pull out some of ""The Best of Alt.Atheism"" for your reading pleasure.  I'll post a couple of these a day unless group concensus demands that I stop, or I run out of good material.  I haven't been particularly careful in the past about saving attributions.  I think the following comes from John A. Johnson, but someone correct me if I'm wrong.  This is probably the longest of my entire collection.  ________________________________________________________   So that the Prophecy be Fulfilled  * * *  In considering the Christian religion, and judging it according to its claims, it is important to look at its claims at fulfilling earlier Jewish prophecy.  The scribe Matthew is perhaps the most eager to draw out what he thinks are prophetic answers in the career of Jesus of Nazareth.  As you will see, Matthew's main strategy is to take various Old Testament passages, often not even about the promised Messiah, and apply them to the circumstances in the New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the authenticity of the accounts.  Since the gospels were written at least 35 years after Jesus was executed, we do not know how much happened exactly as stated.  But, for purposes of analysis, we will take particular claims at face value.  Immanuel:  We begin, of course, at the beginning.  (Mt 1.21-22):  ""[Mary] will bear a son, and you, Joseph, will name him 'Jesus' (which means G'd is salvation), for he will save his people from their sins.""  All this happened to fulfil what the lord had spoken by a prophet:  [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the days of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE), king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz and his court in Judah) were told of this, ...its heart and the heart of its people shook...   And, the lord G'd said to Isaiah, ""go to meet with Ahaz..."" ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah, naturally) saying, ""Ask a sign of G'd your lord.  It can be as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven.""  But, Ahaz said, ""I won't ask; I will not put the lord to a test.""  Then (Isaiah) said, ""Hear then, O house of David.  Is it not enough for you to weary men, that you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman is with child and will bear a son, and name him ""Immanuel,"" which means, ""G'd is with us.""   He will eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse evil and choose good.  For, before the child knows how to refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two kings you dread will have been deserted...  Matthew homes in on just the sentence that is in italics. Further, he the Hebrew word ""almah,"" (young woman), as specifically, ""virgin.""  But, this is not a prophecy about the Messiah.  It is not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 years later.  It is not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In short, it not about Jesus.  Matthew has made use of a verse out of context, and tries to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It should be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general manner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary, virgin or not, was indeed a young woman with child.  Of course, the fit is shady and has problems.  Jesus, while thought of by later Christians to be G'd walking among men, was never called by the name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wished to claim this prophecy for Jesus, it becomes at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second class prophecy.   Not too convincing.  Egypt:  After Jesus's birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tells about a quick (and elsewhere unmentioned) excursion to Egypt, as if he wishes to liken Jesus to Moses.  This was done to escape an alleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.  [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of Herod.  This was to fulfil what the lord had spoken: ""Out of Egypt I have cal-led my son.""   What the lord really said was this.  [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel was a child, I loved him. And, out of Egypt I called my son.  The more I called them (my people), the more they went from me; they kept sacrificing to the Ba'als, and kept burning incense to idols.  Matthew conveniently omits the rest of Hosea's oracle.  But, it was indeed Israel that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to return.  This is history.  Jesus is certainly not being spoken of here.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind up with a Jesus that flees and resists G'd.   Again, this prophecy is just not as convincing as Matthew probably had hoped.  Rachel Weeps:  While Jesus is off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew says that King Herod sought to kill him, and thus ordered the executions of all young male children.  Matthew then writes,  [Mt 2.17-18]   By this, that which was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled:  ""A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they were no more.""  The reference is to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the carrying off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722 BCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribes of Israel, Ephraim, and Manasseh, is said to weep for her descendants who are ""no more.""  It is metaphorical, of course, since Rachel lived and dies before the Hebrews were even in the Egyptian exile. It is interesting to note that it was Leah, not Rachel, who was the ancestor of the Judeans (the land where Jesus and Bethlehem were).  If anyone should do weeping for her ""children,"" it is Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel has with Bethlehem is that the legends have it that she was buried north of the city, ""on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem)."" As for Herod and his infanticide, it is rather unlikely that such an event actually occurred.  One never knows, but the event is not mentioned or alluded to anywhere else in the Bible, nor is it mentioned in any of the secular records of the time. Herod was particularly unliked in his reign, and many far less evil deeds of Herod were carefully recorded.  This might be a prime example of how events were added to Jesus's life to enhance the message of the church's gospel. Because of the whole story's similarity to the tale of the infant Moses in Egypt, it is highly likely that it is a device set up by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesus. It is not surprising that Matthew conveniently neglects to mention the rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The ""children"" the prophet speaks of are not dead, but exiled in the Assyrian Empire.  G'd comforts the weeping Rachel, saying that the children will be returned-- he will gather them back together.  Of course, this would not suit Matthew's purpose, as the children he speaks of are dead for good.  Again, the ""prophecy"" Matthew sets up is not even that, and to anyone who bothers to check it out, is not too convincing.  The Nazarene:  We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find another Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Joseph & wife take the infant Jesus to live in the city of Nazareth,  [Mt 2.23]  ...that what was spoken of by the prophets might be fulfilled, ""He shall be called a Nazarene.""  First thing we notice is that Matthew does not mention the name of the prophet(s) this time.  Second, we have to ask who ""He"" is. There are no Messianic prophecies speaking of a Nazarene.  Worse, there are no prophecies, period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still worse, there are no Nazarenes mentioned in the Old Testament at all.  In the book of Judges, an angel tells Samson's mother that she will,  [Judges 13.5]  ""...conceive and bear a son.  No razor shall tough his head, for he will be a Nazirite to his god from the day of his birth.  He will deliver Israel from the hands of the Philistines.""  This is of course not a prophecy of Jesus, or the messiah of G'd. But, it is the best that can be found.  Obviously, Matthew has begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecies, in that he is simple making them up now.  Bearing our Diseases:  Jesus next goes around healing people of physical illnesses and disabilities.  [Mt 8.17]   This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, ""He took our infirmities and bore our diseases.""  As expected, the verse quoted in Isaiah is quoted out of context, and a few words are skewed to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,  [Is 53.4]  Surely he, [the suffering servant], has borne our sickness, and carried our pains.  From a reading of the surrounding passages in Isaiah, we know that the prophet is speaking in present tense of the collective nation of Israel, Jehovah's chosen servant and people.  He speaks to the Israelites suffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nations that look upon it.  This image is deeply ingrained in Jewish identity --an image of a chastised, yet cherished, Israel as the instrument of the nations' salvation by G'd. The verses speak of Israel taking on the sicknesses which are the literal and metaphorical manifestations of guilt and discipline.  They do not speak of a ""servant"" going around and healing people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah takes on the sicknesses and pains of the nations (and individual Jews).  Jesus, as we all know, did not take the diseases onto himself.  The verses here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of something to come, but rather something that had already happened.  While it is believed that Jesus took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear the illnesses he healed.  So, while someone might want to say that, figuratively, Jesus reenacted the deeds of Israel in his spiritual atonement, he has to admit that Matthew's parallel misses where he intended it to have its effect.   Silent Messiah:  Upon healing multitudes of commoners, it is said that Jesus ordered them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn't arouse the attention of the local rulers.  [Mt 12.15-21]  This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah.  ""Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved, with whom my soul is pleased.  I will put my spirit on him, and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.  He will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets.  He will not break a bruised reed or quench a smoldering wick until he brings justice to victory, and the gentiles will hope in his name.""  The Isaiah passage quoted reads,  [Is 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my chosen, in whom my soul delights.  I have put my spirit on him, and he will bring forth justice to the nations.  We will not cry or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street.  He will not break a bruised reed, or quench a smoldering wick.  He will faithfully bring forth justice.  He will not fail (burn dimly) or be discouraged (bruised) until he has established justice in the earth.  And the coastlands await his law.  You see, Matthew has conveniently left out part of the passage, because it does not suit the dealings of Jesus.  Christians could never think of Jesus failing, never would the ""light"" of mankind burn dimly.  But, the servant nation of Israel will indeed come to an end when its job is done.  When the gentiles come to embrace G'd there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will be the children of G'd.  Also, the ending phrase has been changed from the Judaic ""...the coastlands await his law."" to the Christologic, ""the Gentiles will hope in his name.""   While the original proclaims the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrites it to fit its strange doctrine of ""believing in the name.""  If one has any doubt the servant referred to is not Jesus, one has only to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the beloved but blind and imperfect servant, ""a people robbed and plundered...""   So, we see that when Matthew's attempt at ""prophecy"" is examined, it crumbles.  Three Days and Three Nights:  Now we come upon a prophecy supposedly uttered by the very mouth of the god Jesus himself.  He speaks of his crucifixion and resurrection.  [Mt 12.40]   For as Jonah was in the belly of the whale for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights.  Before any further discussion can occur, it is necessary to know how the Jews understood days.  As far as day names went, each was 24 hours long, lasting from sunset 6pm to the following sunset 6pm.  What was referred to as a ""day"" was the period of light from 6am to the ending sunset at 6pm.  Thus, according to our time scale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and lasted until 6pm saturday evening.  This is why the Jews celebrate their sabbath on the daylight portion of Saturdays, instead of Sundays. (It seems like a real miracle that Christians didn't forget that Saturday was indeed the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thus, when days and nights are referred to together, 12 hour daylight portions and 12 hour night periods are being spoken of.  Thus, Jesus says that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise unresurrected for three days and three nights.  As the good book tells us, Jesus was crucified on the ""ninth hour,"" which is 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then was put into the grave sometime after that.  Then, Jesus left the grave, ""rose,"" before dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath was over).  What this means is that Jesus was, using our time for clarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before 6am Sunday morning.  We could also add a little time before 6pm Friday, since the bible is not specific here.  What this means using Jewish time is that he was in the grave for one day, two nights, and possibly a couple of hours of one day.  Certainly this is a problem for Jesus prediction.  There is absolutely no way we are even able to have his death involve three days and three nights --even using modern time measurements.   We then are led to suspect that this error is another one of Matthew's little mistakes, and that the gospel writer put false words into his god's mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it is more than unconvincing... it is counter-convincing.  Hearing & Understanding:  Jesus tool on a habit of speaking to his vast audiences in parables-- stories in which a deeper meaning could be found, if you were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the message of Jesus.  He reasons that those who can understand the parables are the ones he wants.  If the people cannot understand them, there is no need to bother with them, since they will not accept the ""plain"" message any better.  Matthew says,  [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah which says,  ""You will indeed hear but never understand; and you will indeed see, but never perceive.  Because this people's heart has grown dull, their ears are heavy of hearing, and they have shut their eyes so the they would not perceive with them, her with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal them.""  The original Isaiah passages are part of his earlier works, his call to the ministry.  This is in 740 BCE, when Israel is flourishing, right before it falls under the authority of Assyria. Isaiah sees the good times ending, and also a vision from G'd, calling him to bring reform to Israel and Judah.  [Is 6.9-13]  And G'd said, ""Go, and say to this people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and see, but do not perceive.'   Make the heart of this people fat, make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, so they will not see with their eyes, or hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed.""  Then Isaiah said, ""How long, lord?""  And he said, ""Until the cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the land is utterly desolate, and the G'ds take men far away, and forsaken places are many in the land.  And though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still stands when the tree is felled."" The holy seed is its stump.  Here we see that it is really G'd who causes the people of Israel to stop listening to the prophet's warnings, but reaffirms the promise made to Solomon's (and David's) seed/lineage.  If you read the rest of Isaiah, you find that this is done to fulfil the plan of G'd to use Israel as a servant, a light to the nations.  (Look at Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3) We see that Matthew has cut-and-pasted just a little portion of Isaiah's verse, to suit his own gospel needs.  More than that, he has altered the words, to make it fit the people who didn't understand Jesus's stories.  And, as we see, Isaiah's verses are not prophecies, but rather commands from G'd to him, in the present.   Once again, Matthew's prophecy falls flat on its face.  Matthew tries again to make Jesus's parables look like they have the prophetic approval.  [Mt 13.35]  ...he said nothing to them without a parable.  This was to fulfil what was spoken of by the prophet, ""I will open my mouth to them in parables.  I will utter that which has been hidden since the foundation of the world.""  Matthew really botches up here.  He attempts to quote not from a prophet, but from the Psalms.  [Ps 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will utter dark sayings of old, things that we all have heard and known, things that our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the lord...  As was pointed out, the verses in the Psalms do not really come from a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copies of Matthew's gospel even inserted Isaiah's name as this prophet. Apparently, later scribes caught the error and tried to cover some of it up. Perhaps the most significant part of this is that, once again, Matthew has altered the Old Testament Scriptures.  As Jesus has said earlier, he speaks in parables so that some will not understand them.  The parables in the Psalms are not to be hidden. Further, they speak of things ""known, that our fathers have told us.""  Jesus deals with things ""hidden since the foundation of the world.""  Indeed Jesus dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. This is in direct opposition to the parables in the Psalms.  No wonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again, Matthew's artificial prophecies fall flat on their face.  But, Christians rarely look at this.  Matthew's prophecies aren't the only things about Christianity that are beginning to look bad.   Excuses of Little Faith:  In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciples are able to go around casting out demons, except in one case.  Not knowing what epilepsy was, the people thought those with the disease were possesed with demons.  It is no wonder that the disciples were unable to ""dispossess"" the epileptic.  But, Jesus, perhaps no more enlightened than they, is reported to have rebuked them, saying they didn't have enough faith.   This seems strange.  Why was this demon special?  It seems that either a true believer has faith or he does not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow someone to move mountains.  Of course, you will find no one, these days that can move real mountains.  No one parts seas.  The only miracles the Charismatics can speak of are those rumoured to happen on trips to Mexico or some faraway place.  Major miracles are making some old woman's arthritis feel better on Sunday morning T.V.  And the gods, including Jesus, are always shrouded in ancient lore and writings, protected from the skeptics in their sacred pasts.  They are either dead, sleeping, or hiding in heaven, with people rumouring about their imminent return and their great miracles of days long gone.  Yet, life goes on.  Tales of mystics, stories of miracles-- all in a distant time or a distant place.  Gods used to reveal themselves to men in the old days, Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the theologians give are various excuses as to why we don't get to see God anymore.  We're too lazy; we're not zealous enough; we're sinful; it's just his ""plan""; we put too many of our own demands on G'd's appearance; if we had the right faith, if we  were willing to meet G'd on his terms...  Yet, even the most pious of men have not seen G'd.  You, dear reader, have not seen G'd.  Not literally, you know that to be true. (I know that's presumptuous and bold.  But, searching your heart, you know what I mean.)  All that we've seen religions do is make people feel good and content about not seeing G'd.  They say our little faith does not merit us to see G'd.  Sometimes, they say, ""See the love in these people you worship with... see the lives of people change... that is seeing G'd.""   Thus people get lulled to sleep, satisfied with turning G'd into the everyday sights.   But, that is not seeing G'd as I am speaking of... it is not seeing G'd the way people used to see. What we see in the world that is good, is the compassion of human hearts, the love given and taken by men and women, the forgiveness practised by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty created by the mind of man.  These are the things that are done; these are what we see.  But, it is said this is so only because everybody has little faith.  Jesus Rides on an Ass:  Shortly after accepting the role of the Jewish messiah king, Jesus requests a donkey be brought in for him to ride into Jerusalem.  [Mt 21.5]  This took place to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet, saying,  Tell the daughter of Zion, ""Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, mounted on an ass, and on a ass-colt.""  Of course, the passage quoted from Zechariah 9.9 reads a little differently.  Lo, your king comes to you; he is triumphant and victorious, humble, and riding on an ass, on an ass- colt... he will command peace to the nations.  There isn't all that much difference here, except that Zechariah only involves one animal  --an ass-colt--  while Matthew reads the poetic wording slightly differently.  Thus, he has Jesus call for both a colt and an adult ass.  From Matthew's version, we get a comical picture of the divine Christ sweating it to straddle two donkeys.  This could inevitably lead to a theological, proctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written earlier by St. Mark, only the colt was called for and brought to Jesus.  This indeed fits the verses of Zechariah properly, and shows us that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verses, he has bungled.  Now, excluding many respectable Christians I have met, I have noticed that while Christ is thought to have ridden on asses, the situation is often reversed nowadays...  Then, entering the Jerusalem temple, the priests were angered at people and youngsters calling Jesus the messiah.  But, Jesus replied as we might expect Matthew to have done,  [Mt 21.16]  Haven't you read?  `Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou has brought perfect praise.'  It is more likely that Matthew made this response up since Jesus was never one to point out such little ""prophetic"" things AND since, as we might expect, the quote is in error, which seems to fit Matthew's track record quite well.  We might ask Jesus or Matthew, ""Haven't you read?"" for the source reads,  [Psalms 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic is your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory is chanted above the heavens by babes and infants, you have founded a bulwark against your foes to still the enemy and the avenger.  The passages hardly need comment.  There is no ""perfect praise"" spoken of in the psalm, and what praise is there is given to G'd, not his messiah king, and not Jesus.  As mentioned, it seems to be just one more case of Matthew's pen making up convenient prophetic scripture.  YHVH said to my lord...:  Jesus is said to have asked from whom the promised Jewish messiah-king is to be descended.  The Jews agree-- it is king David.  But, then Jesus counters by quoting Psalms 110,  ""The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.""  Taken at face value, Jesus is denying the necessity of Davidic descent.  One assumes he is in opposition to their answer.  Of course, the Christian answer is that he agrees, but is trying to make some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine nature of the messiah-king.  It's tempting to believe this, if one is a Christian and not interested in matters of investigation. But, there are problems. In Jesus's time, the psalm was thought to be about the messiah.  And, it is easy to see why David might refer to the messiah as his superior.  We need only look at the scriptures about the messiah to see that he is expected to be a great king, bringing the Jews to times even better than those under David's rule.  Of course, the Jews listening had no good answer, and the passage could indeed refer to a divine messiah, such as the Christians worship.  The problem lies in the meaning of this psalm, an error that apparently several Jews of Jesus's time had also made.  One must remember that there were various factions among the Jews, often as a result of different expectations of the messiah-king.  Jesus was apparently one of these adventists, like his audience, who thought the messiah's advent was imminent, and who interpreted Psalms 110, among others, as being messianic. What is the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literally reads,  YHVH's utterance to my lord: ""Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.""  YHVH sends forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule in the midst of your foes!  Your people will offer themselves freely on the day you lead your host on the holy mountains.  ""You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek forever.""  The word ""lord"" is often mistakenly capitalised by Christian bibles to denote divinity in this lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the word is ""adoni,"" and no capitalisation exists.  Adoni simply means ""lord,"" a generic term as we would use it.  It is used often in the scriptures to refer to kings and to G'd.  It is merely an address of respect. There is nothing in the text itself to imply that the word refers either to divinity or to the messiah-king.  That this is supposed to be written by David is not certain.  The title of the psalm translates to either ""a psalm of David,"" or ""a psalm about David.""  It seems fitting to assume it to be written by a court poet, about David's covenant and endorsement from G'd.  If the psalm had been written by David, it is unlikely that he would be talking about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect king, descended from David, was not present in David's age.  We have extensive tales of David's doings and sayings-- none of which include any praises of a messiah. Many of the psalms show evidence of being written long after David was dead, in times of the exile when G'd had put his show of favour for David's kingdom on hold. The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David was promised by G'd a rise to power, victory over his enemies, successful judgement among the nations he conquered.  He achieved the priesthood common to Melchizedek in being a righteous king, enabled to bless the people.   It all fits. We do not have to blame this problem on Matthew alone, though.  Here, there is not artificial prophecy alluded to, though his use of the scripture is rather questionable.  Still, this event is common to the other gospels too.  So, we let Matthew off a little more easily this time.  It is interesting to note, though, how Matthew dresses up the event.  The earlier gospel of Mark tells the tale with Jesus simply speaking to a crowd. Matthew has the Pharisees, who became the religious competition of an infant Christianity, be the target of Jesus's question.  As we might expect, Matthew writes that the event ends up by embarrassing the Pharisees.  Such power is the pen.  Moses & Jesus, Had it Together All Along...:  We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentarily to see a pseudo-prophecy in John's gospel.  The gospel story of John deserves special treatment, because it seems to be so far removed from the real events of Jesus's career as told by even Matthew. But, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The early church leaders founded a religion on the Jewish hopes of a messiah king, and on an artificial extension of the original promises made by G'd.  When constructing the history of Abraham, Moses wrote of a promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While this was accomplished eventually, under the rule of king David, the Christians who came along later decided that they would claim the fulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expanded on the promise, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.  [John 8.56] (J.C. speaking) Your father, Abraham, rejoiced to see My day.  He say it and was glad.  It would be nice to tie in approval for Jesus from Abraham, but, Abraham knew nothing of Jesus or a messiah, or anything Christian. I have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Testament which corresponds to John's little prophecy.  It is par for the course to see St. John making up Old Testament backings, just like his forerunner Matthew.  Many Christians know that their faith has many of its foundations in such fraud, and it is surprising they still cling to it.  The Potter's Field:  We are told that Jesus was betrayed while in Jerusalem by one of his followers, Judas Iscariot.   Matthew writes,  [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, [Judas] departed... But, the chief priests, taking the silver, said, ""It isn't lawful for us to put it in the treasury, since it is blood money.""  So they... bought a potter's field with it to bury strangers in... Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,  ""And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's field, as the lord directed me.""  This prophecy is an utterly gross bastardisation of Old Testament Scripture.  First, Matthew has made a mistake regarding the name of the prophet.  It is Zechariah who utters the verses which Matthew makes use of.  [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wages, thirty shekels of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, ""Cast them to the treasury,"" --the lordly price at which I was paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekels of silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of YHVH.  First of all, the verses of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer of the messiah, or of G'd.  The deal with a shepherd, most likely a priest, chosen to serve a function of presiding over the people shortly before G'd would send Judah and Israel into conflict with one another.  The word, ""treasury,"" had been replaced by the King James Scholars with ""to the potter,"" precisely because this made Matthew's quote fit better.  But, this is a blatant error.  The correct translation of the Hebrew is indeed ""treasury,"" which also makes perfect sense in Zechariah's context, whereas ""potter's field"" is totally unrelated.  Whether the mistranslation was intentional or not seems to be beyond speculation.  However, given Matthew's track record, one finds it hard to resist the notion of intentional dishonesty. Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for altering the text.  The thirty pieces of silver match Judas's situation, and if as most Christians seem to be, the reader is willing to disregard the contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to toss around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah directly contradicts the situation with Judas and the high priests.  The high priests would not put the money in the treasury.  The worthless shepherd of Zechariah does exactly the opposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student, the ""prophecy"" as presented by Matthew would be taken at New Testament face value.  To those, Matthew's work is convincing enough.  Wine, Vinegar, & Casting Lots:  Then, Jesus is led away to be crucified.  [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots: that it might be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet,  ""They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.""  First of all, the vinegar offered to Jesus is actually common sour wine, of the type that Roman soldiers drank regularly.  We find that right before Jesus dies, the soldiers themselves give him some to drink --not polluted with gall.  [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesus... said, ""I thirst.""  A bowl of vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.  When he had received the vinegar, he said, ""It is finished;""  But, Matthew seems to be drawing on, not a passage from the prophets, but one from the Psalms.  [Ps 69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there was none; and for comforters, but I found none.  They gave me poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the Book of the Living.  Of course, the sour wine offered to Jesus is done at his request of drink.  This does indeed seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm quoted is about David and his political and military enemies.  It is not about the messiah or Jesus.  It is then not surprising that we run into further problem when we see that the ""Jesus"" in the psalm asks G'd for the damnation of the ""crucifiers,"" whereas the Jesus of the gospels says,  [Lk 23.34]  Jesus said, ""Father, forgive them, the don't know what they do!""  Further, Matthew misses with his attempt to create prophecy by having gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesus's drink, not his meat, as the psalm stipulates.  With the ""prophecy"" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally ask, ""What of the casting of lots?""  This brings up the 22nd Psalm, which deserves discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to say that the fact that Jesus's clothes were divided as told is no great thing.  It turns out that this happened often to any felon in those days.  As we will soon see, it is perhaps the least erroneous passage of the psalm when applied to Jesus.  It does indeed bring up the interesting question as to the quality of Jesus's clothes.  For a man so removed from worldly possessions, his ownership of clothes worthy of casting lots raises some suspicions.  The 22nd Psalm:  This psalm is attributed to David, as a lament of his condition under the attack of his enemies.  It becomes a song of praise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, parts of it seem to fit the plight of Jesus at the crucifixion quite well.  We will examine the primary passages.  Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! Why are you so far from helping me, far from the words of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you don't answer, and by night, but find no rest.  Jesus is said to have cried the first sentence while on the cross. This suggests that the whole psalm is really about Jesus, rather than king David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza does not fit as nicely to Jesus or his execution.  Jesus is not pictured as complaining about the whole ordeal, he is supposed to be like ""the lamb led mute before its shearers.""  Indeed, Jesus doesn't do much groaning, even when on the cross.  He certainly does not cry by both day and night on the cross.  6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorned by men... All who see me mock at me.  They make faces and wag their heads;  ""He committed his cause to YHVH.  So let him deliver him... for he delights in him.""  This seems to fit Jesus's execution pretty well, with the exception of the Holy messiah being called a worm.  12-13:  Many bulls encompass me... they open their mouths widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.  16-18:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of evildoers encir-cle me, they have pierced my hands and feet.  I can see all my bones... They divide my garments among them, and cast lost for my raiment.  19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my soul from the sword, my life from the power of the dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my afflicted soul from the horns of the wild bull!  It would seem quite convincing, and I'm sure the early Christian fathers who wrote of this prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunately, this prophecy has a fatal flaw.  The words ""have pierced"" really do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation is,  16:  Yea, dogs are round about me, a company of evildoers encircles me, like the lion, they are at my hands and feet...  In Hebrew the phrase ""like the lion"" and a very rare verb form which can mean ""pierced"" differ by one phonetic character.  The word in the Hebrew text is literally, ""like the lion"" (ka'ari), which makes sense in the context, and even further fits the animal imagery employed by the psalm writer.  It is convenience that would urge a Christian to change the word to ""ka'aru.""   But, to add the needed (yet artificial) weight to the ""prophecy"" this is just what the Christian translators have chosen to do.  While the correct translation does not eliminate the psalm from referring to Jesus, its absence does not say much for the honesty of the translators.  Apart from the erroneous verse 16, the psalm does not lend itself to Jesus so easily.  Verse 20 speaks of the sufferer being saved from a sword rather than a cross.  This naturally fits the psalm's true subject, king David.  As a side note, we now know that crucifixions did not pierce the hands, the palms, but rather the forearms.  This doesn't say much in favour of the traditional thought of a resurrected Jesus showing his disciples the scars on his palms.  But then, facts aren't bound by our religious beliefs.  Matthew escapes culpability this time, as he does not attempt to draw many direct links between this psalm and his lord Jesus.  But the psalm, like many others, was on the minds of all the gospel writers when they compiled the stories and interpretations of Jesus's life and death.  How much these scriptures may have contributed to what actually got written down is a question that has serious repercussions for Christian theology.  It is easy to see, for those who are not faithful fundamentalists, how some of the events in the New Testament might have been ""enhanced"" by scribes such as the eager Matthew.  But, it does less to speculate than to simply investigate scriptural matters and prophetic claims.  So far, this has not said good things for St. Matthew.  The reference to the piercing looks a lot like Jesus's crucifixion.  John's gospel recount, written about 70 years after the fact, tells us at Jesus's execution,  [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and out came blood and water... these things took place that Scripture be fulfilled... ""The will look on him whom they've pierced.""  Of course, this is built on a passage taken blatantly out of context.   Prophet Zechariah tells us how much of the nation of Israel will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with them.  [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah... And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nations that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him like you weep over a firstborn child.  John's attempt to make up prophecy is perhaps weaker that Matthew's attempts.  Matthew, at least, usually excontexts more than just one passage.  John's errors are grossly obvious and blatant here.  It does not speak well for any of the gospel writers, as it helps to show how the prophetic aspects of their religion were founded.   Reckoned with Transgressors:  After his arrest, Jesus is quickly executed for claiming the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   According to one version of the gospel tale, Jesus gets executed along with two thieves.  [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right, one on his left.  And so the scripture was fulfilled which says,  ""He was reckoned with the transgressors.""  Here, Mark is trying to link Jesus to a passage in Isaiah 53, about the servant nation of Israel.  The passage is not about the messiah, for if one reads the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and its surrounding chapters, one sees that the servant is a nation.  The verses are also about what this servant has gone through in the past, not a prediction of what is to come, in any event.  The servant is thought of as a criminal.  This also happens to fit the description of Jesus.  Had the passage really been about the messiah, it still is not at all clear why executing Jesus between two thieves would fulfill the ""prophecy"" in Isaiah.  Jesus would more fittingly fulfill it with his whole ministry.  He was considered a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout his career.   Locking onto a single event is a rather poor way to steal prophecy, at least in this case, as we see that Mark could have had made a better analogy with general comparisons.  Mark goes on to tell us how ""those who were crucified with [Jesus] also reviled him."" [15.32]  This is to be expected from a couple of robbers.  Of course in his later recount, St. Luke decides to change some things.  Luke tells us,  [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminals who was hanged with him railed, ""Aren't you the messiah?! Save yourself, and us!""  This certainly fits with Mark's recount, which tells how the people who crucified Jesus said, ""Save yourself!"" and that the robbers did the same.  But then Luke goes on,  But the other [criminal] rebuked [the first] saying, ""Don't you fear G'd, since you are under the same sentence of condemnation?  And we, indeed justly so, for we are receiving the due reward for our deeds. But, this man has done nothing wrong. And he said, ""Jesus, remember me when you come in your kingdom."" And Jesus answered, ""Verily I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.""  Now, this little dialogue seems highly contrived.  It stretches the imagination a bit to see this picture of one ruffian rebuking his fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather strange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodness of his punishment and the justness of his suffering.   Such a man, apparently noble and of principle, doesn't seem likely to have been a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatrics created by Luke.  Of course, Luke's recount also disagrees with Mark's. Luke has only one criminal revile Jesus, not both.  It is easy enough to discount the discrepancy because the account was made up, but those who wish to believe it is all part of the error free words of G'd do not have this avenue open.  This is yet another example of a writer trying to take an Old Testament passage and expand it and reinterpret it to suit his theology.  In this case, the embroidery creates some embarrassing problems, as we have seen.  The End of the World-- Mt. 24:  Now comes perhaps one of the most extraordinary and embarrassing passages in the New Testament.  It is found in all three of the synoptic gospel stories, and casts some of the most unfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesus mentions the destruction of the Jewish temples and buildings, and his disciples ask him about this, and about the end of the world which he has been warning about.  The disciples: Tell us, when will this [the temple's destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your coming, and of the close of the age?  Jesus: Take care that no one leads you astray, for many will come in my name, saying, ""I am the christ."" ...you will hear of wars and rumours of wars... for this must take place, but the end is not yet.   For, nation will rise against nation... all this is but the beginning of the birthpangs. They will deliver you up... put you to death, and false prophets will arise and lead many astray. ...But he who endures to the end will be saved.  This gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, a testimony to the nations, and then the end will come. So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.  Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened... the stars will fall from heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and see the Son of Man coming... and he will send out his angels... and gather his elect... Learn the lesson of the fig tree: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts forth leaves, you know that summer is near.  So also, when you see all these things, you will know that He is near, at the very gate.  Truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place... But, of the day and hour, no one knows; not the angels, not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore, you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect.  From this, it is clear that Jesus thought the world would in within the lifetimes of at least some of his disciples.  He tells them that although he doesn't know the exact day or hour, that it will come, and thus they must be ready.  Theologians have wet their pants in panic to find some way out of this Holy Error. But, unfortunately, Jesus made himself to explicit.  He told his disciples that their generation would still be around at the End, and that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be swept away. There have been some who resorted to removing the inerrant nature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, ""this generation shall not pass away..."" really means ""this race of people will not pass away...""  Of course, the word for generation is used many times to refer to exactly that, the generation of the disciples. It is an interesting notion that when God decided to learn Greek, he didn't learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it is quite obvious from the rest of the dialogue that the disciples (at least some of them) are supposed to live to the End of the World. The charge of mistranslation is completely blown away by looking at the Apostles' responses.  It becomes abundantly clear from Rev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesus meant exactly what he said.  The End was very near.  For 2,000 years, Christians have rationalised this 24th chapter of Matthew, or ignored its meaning altogether.  For 2,000 years, they have waited for their executed leader to come back, hearing of wars, and rumours of wars, sure that He is coming soon. Surely He must be.  All we must do is wait.  Can you imagine how tired He must be, sitting around up there, being holy, waiting for just the right moment to spring?   So, shortly after his crucifixion, Jesus of Nazareth, (Joshua-ben-Joseph), died.   It is said that after three days, or three days and three nights, or three periods of time, or three eternal seconds --or three of whatever they can decide makes for less trouble-- he was seen again, resurrected, glowing with divine radiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wasn't in the best interests of his new religion to stick around, and therefore disappeared from sight into heaven.  So the story goes, anyway. As has been seen, there were many things attributed to Jesus when people got around to writing the gospel stories down.  To them, Jesus was the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have seen, though, that this matter is quite shaky.  But, throughout Church history, Christians have held fast to faith, in simple belief.  What doctrinal objections could not be solved with argumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulness kept away from question.  To question and investigate has never been the easiest way to treat matters.  Thus for 2,000 years, the prophecies cited in the New Testament have gone on largely accepted.  Things may well continue that way for some time. Pausing a moment to consider the way the doctrines of Christianity have been accepted and used (properly or improperly) to support wars and persecution, I suppose there is one prophecy of which Christianity can securely keep hold.  [Mt 10.34]  Jesus: ""Don't think that I have come to bring peace on earth.  I haven't come to bring peace, but rather a sword.""    "

I think you are vastly oversimplifying things. We know that early Christians suffered totures because of their witness to Christ.  For example:  ACT 5:40    His speech persuaded them. They called the apostles in and had them flogged. Then they ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.  ACT 5:41    The apostles left the Sanhedrin, rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering disgrace for the Name.  It appears that the Jewish rulers of that time had a particular aversion to even hearing Jesus's name. ACT 5:28    ""We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,"" he said. ""Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to make us guilty of this man's blood.""  Finally, the first apostle's death, James of Zebedee was certainly not by Rome's hand any more than the first martyr Stephen.   >The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different >forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection >which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population  The problem was that if one believed in the Resurrection, then one must believe in Jesus as truly being the Son of God and what He stood for and preached during His ministry on Earth.  That would have been extremely difficult for some people, especially those that had plotted to kill Him.  >randy  -- John G. Ata - Technical Consultant | Internet:  ata@hfsi.com HFS, Inc.

If you would bother to check in any good dictioanry or thesaurus, I think you will find that ""arrogance"" has to do with an offensive exhibition of presumed or real superiority (a paraphrase from my own Webster's). Arrognace is about pride and haughtiness. A person can believe in absolute truth, even blindly (whatever that means) without being obnoxious about it. Just as a person can be a ""humble,"" authority-questioning, defying-any-theist-to-reply athiest and be quite arrogant. Arrogance is not about what you believe, it is about how you relate to what you believe and how you present it to others. If your overwhelming experience of Christians has been that they are arrogant, I apologozing both for myself and on the behalf of those who have offfended you. But my own experience, at least in forums like Usenet where you see a good mix of people, is that arrogant Christians and athiests seems to occur in about equal numbers.  - Phil -  Hey, we're talking about the PHONE COMPANY, here.

Could > someone explain what the Command Loss Timer is?  The name is rather descriptive.  It's a command to the spacecraft that tells it ""If you don't hear from Earth after 264 hours, assume something is wrong with your (the spacecraft) attitude, and go into a preprogrammed search mode in an attempt to reacquire the signal from Earth.""  The spacecraft and Earth are not in constant communication with each other. Earth monitors the telemetry from the spacecraft, and if everything is fine, there's no reason to send it any new information.  But from the spacecraft's point of view, no information from Earth could mean either everything is fine, or that the spacecraft has lost signal acquisition.  Just how long should the spacecraft wait before it decides that something is wrong and begins to take corrective action?  That ""how long"" is the command loss timer. During relatively inactive cruise phases, the command loss timer can be set to rather long values.  In this case, Earth is telling Galileo ""expect to hear back from us sometime within the next 264 hours"". "

We have been using our processes since way before Challenger.  Challenger in and of it self did not uncover flaws.  2. What Mr. Spencer says is by and large true.  We have a process that is not dependent on ""sophisticated tools""  (CASE tools?).  However, tools cannot fix a bad process.  Also, tool support for HAL/S (the Shuttle Language) is somewhat limited.  3. The Onboard Flight Software project was rated ""Level 5"" by a NASA team. This group generates 20-40 KSLOCs of verified code per year for NASA.  4. Feel free to call me if you or your organization is interested in more info on our software development process.

People will hate who they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or hammer&sickle.

The net can't set public policy, that's what your representatives are for.   WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS  Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on microfilm.  The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch from.  By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design.   WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE  Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early in a mission.   RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES  There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small. Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2 RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].  To make your own informed judgement, some references you may wish to pursue are:  A good review of the technical facts and issues is given by Daniel Salisbury in ""Radiation Risk and Planetary Exploration-- The RTG Controversy,"" *Planetary Report*, May-June 1987, pages 3-7.

Hanson, editor; DOE Document No.  DOE/TIC-22800; Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C., April 1980.)   IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER  From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study, Charles Jackman.  The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.  The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:  Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year  The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the total stratospheric chlorine sources.  The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.  The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time.  Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical Research, 95, 18583-18590, 1990.

HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE  If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.  Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue) start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes, you're dying. The limits are not really known.

Dunn, eds, Report SAM-TR-65-48 (June 1965), USAF School of Aerospace Medicine, Brooks AFB, Texas.   HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED  The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example. What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin team's medical/forensic report.  The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team examined them, they were sent off to be buried.   USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT  You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.  Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit spacecraft.  [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]   THE ""FACE ON MARS""  There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery: 35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13 (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).  Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't know the address) to study the Face.  The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or sci.astro.  V. DiPeitro and G.

Like fuel for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.  But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9 billion for the US share.  I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious, that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and equipment would weigh?  And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10 engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the DC-1.  All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.  Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine. Does this ring a bell to anyone?

I think depression is more likely to come from emotional problems (relationships, family, job, friends) and promiscuity is used as an escape. Since I see marriage as a civil and religious bond rather than an emotional bond, I don't see a problem with sex before (not outside of) marriage so long as you have the same commitment and devotion as what is expected from a married couple.

That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.

Indeed, as many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute, but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.  >So, I think that your position is: >The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our >interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out >what that truth is. >Did I get that right?  Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably* determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The distinction is subtle yet important.  When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken, without sacrificing his convictions.  Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty. Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the right direction when he uttered, ""Cogito, ergo sum,"" yet we have not advanced much beyond that.  Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course, you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) abandon these absolutes.  >What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending >absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we >can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?

Religious Studies Dept, Saint Mary's University, Halifax, N.S. >Armstrong@husky1.stmarys.ca | att!clyde!watmath!water!dalcs!armstrng  I apologize to the moderator, but the first quote was deleted and I would like to respond to both.  As for the ""goal we can never achieve"", the reward comes from the trying.  Paul makes a clear claim that we are to continue straining for the prize over in Philippians 3:10-16.  Only by not living out the commands do we stagnate and become lukewarm, to be spit out by Jesus. As it says in 1 John 5:3:  ""This is love for God:  to obey his comands."" That obedience is our straining to achieve for God.  Of course, this requires work on our part.  As for the quote in James, Satan doesn't care what we believe.  What matters is the results of our belief (works).  If one truly has faith in what one believes, one will either act on that faith or be lying to oneself about believing in the first place.  Stan, as for your first line, you have a very good point.  Obedience by obligation (grudgery) is not what God desires.  Instead, look at how many times the Bible talks about being joyous in all situations and when doing God's work.  Being begrudged by the work has no value.  Also, we should do the work necessary whenever we can, not just when we feel Jesus' presence.  Feelings can deceive us.  However, as Paul states to Timothy in 2 Timothy 4:2:  ""Preach the Word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage--with great patience and careful instruction.""  Also, remember that Paul tells Timothy in 1 Timothy 4:16:  ""Watch your life and doctrine closely.  Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save both yourself and your hearers."" So, in order to do the work necessary, we need to be sure that we are correct first.  Remember Jesus' warning in Matthew 7:3-5 not to be hypocritical about what we do.  The best way to accomplish this is to be a disciple completely in both thought and deed.  Joe Fisher  "

As you might expect, there is a range of answers.  Catholics and some others will say that divorce is never justified.  (By the way, in situations where someone is being abused, or for other serious cause, separation is allowed by all traditions that I know.  No one should be forced to stay in a situation where they are in danger.)  Others see it as a last resort in situations that have fallen apart badly enough that the best we can hope for is to choose the lesser of evils.  In some sense the difficult legal question turns out not to be divorce, but remarriage.  That's because of Jesus' statement in Mark 10:11-12 and par.  As with so many other things, this turns on your approach to the Bible.  Conservative Protestants tend to see statements like this as having no exceptions. More liberal ones are willing to make allowances for situations where a literal interpretation would lead to painful results.  (It is noted that at the time it was possible for a man to divorce his wife almost on a whim.  Thus a common explanation in the more liberal approach is that Jesus was trying to protect people from this sort of thing, not to establish an absolute rule to which there could never be exceptions.)  Catholics, as is typical with Catholic ethics, take a theoretical hard line, but allow for exceptions in practice through the process of anullment.  In the last discussion most of our non-Catholic readers seemed to accept with some reluctance that in some cases there might be no good alternative, but there was a feeling that the church should often be doing a better job of helping people prepare for marriage and deal with problems that come up during it, and that in a properly run church, divorce should not be necessary.  --clh] "

That's like saying that, since mathematics includes no instructions on how to act, it is evil.  Atheism is not a moral system, so why should it speak of instructions on how to act?  *Atheism is simply lack of belief in God*.  Plenty of theists >think so.

I think the argument that a particular theist system causes genocide can be made more convincingly than an argument that atheism causes genocide. This is because theist systems contain instructions on how to act, and one or more of these can be shown to cause genocide.

Seems to me if you learned to differentiate between illusion and reality on your own you wouldn't need to rely on doctrines that need to be updated.  My experience of Christianity (25+ years) is that most Christians seek answers from clergymen who have little or no direct experience of spiritual matters, and that most of these questions can be answered by simple introspection.  Most people suspect that they cannot trust their senses, but few take the next step to figure out that they can trust themselves.  Not to get too esoteric, but it seems that most religions, Christianity included, are founded by particularly intuitive people who understand this.

It makes more sense to me that rather than be converted to a centuries-old doctrine that holds no life for her, that she simply continue to decide for herself what is best.  --------------------------------------------  [You may be right about Christians relying on clergy, but I have some reason to hope you're not.  Protestants emphasize conversion, experience of the Holy Spirit, and use of the Bible.  This is intended to make sure that Christians have religious experience of their own, and that they have some basis on which to judge claims of clergy and other Christians.  I can't speak for Catholics and Orthodox, but I believe they also attempt to avoid having members who simply repeat what they are told.  I admit that this isn't always successful -- we certainly see young people join our church because at that age parents expect it.  But most of our members do seem quite able and willing to make judgements for themselves, and have a commitment that comes out of their own experience.  Unfortunately, it's the nature of Usenet that doctrinal disagreements get emphasized, so it looks like we spend most of our time dealing with doctrine.  That's certainly not my experience of the way Christians really live.  --clh] "

Gregg is not, as I understand his posts, giving any support to the bounty on Rushdie's life.  If that's correct, end of one point...  Gregg is using the concept of legal in a way most Westerners don't accept. His comments about Islamic Law I think make a great deal of sense to him, and are even making a _little_ sense to me now - if a person is a member of a group (religion or whatever) they bind themselves to follow the ways of the group within the bounds of what the group requires as a minimum. The big bone of contention here that I'm picking up is that in the West we have secular governments that maintain, more or less, a level of control and of requirements outside the requirements of optional groups.  I think the majority of us reading this thread are in tune (note - I didn't say ""in agreement"") with the idea that you are finally responsible to the secular government,  and within that to the group or groups a person may have chosen.  With that in mind, it not possible under secular law (""legally"" as most people would define the term) to hold a person to a particular group once they decide to separate from it.  Only if the secular authorities agree that there is a requirement of some sort (contractual, etc) is there any secular _enforcement_ allowed by a group to a group member or past group member.  A religion can, and often does, believe in and require additional duties of a group member.  And it can enforce the fulfillment of those duties in many ways - ostracism is common for example.  But the limit comes when the enforcement would impose unwanted and/or unaccepted onus on a person _in conflict with secular law_.  This is the difference.  In a theocracy, the requirements of the secular authorities are, by definition, congruent with the religious authorities. Outside a theocracy, this is not _necessarily_ true.  Religious requirements _may_ coincide or may not.  Similiarly, religious consequences _may_ or may not coincide with secular consequences (if any).

With my appreciation to the moderator, I believe that further elaboration is needed. This is an excerpt from an article featured in the first issue of the Copt-Net Newsletter :  Under the authority of the Eastern Roman Empire of Constantinople (as opposed to the western empire of Rome), the Patriarchs and Popes of Alexandria played leading roles in  Christian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to speak about the Christian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, was the head of the Ecumenical Council which was held in Ephesus in the year 430 A.D. It was said that the bishops of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but spend  all their time in meetings. This leading role, however, did not fare well when politics started to intermingle with  Church affairs.  It all started when the Emperor Marcianus interfered with matters of faith in the Church. The response of St. Dioscorus, the Pope of Alexandria who was later  exiled, to this interference was clear: ""You have nothing to do with the Church.""  These political motives became even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  was unfairly  accused of following  the  teachings of  Eutyches, who believed  in monophysitism. This  doctrine maintains that the  Lord Jesus Christ  has only one nature, the divine, not two natures, the human as well as the divine.  The Coptic  Church   has never  believed  in  monophysitism  the way   it was portrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophysitism meant believing in one  nature.  Copts   believe that the Lord   is perfect in  His divinity,  and He   is perfect in  His humanity,  but  His  divinity  and His humanity were united in one nature called ""the nature of the incarnate word"", which was reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copts, thus, believe in two natures ""human"" and   ""divine""  that are   united in   one ""without mingling, without confusion, and without alteration"" (from the  declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  These  two  natures ""did not separate for a moment or the twinkling of an eye"" (also from  the declaration of faith at the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  The  Coptic Church was  misunderstood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of Chalcedon.  Perhaps the Council  understood   the Church correctly, but  they wanted to exile the  Church,   to  isolate it  and to  abolish the  Egyptian, independent Pope. Despite  all of this,  the Coptic Church  has remained very strict  and steadfast in its faith.   Whether it was   a  conspiracy from the Western Churches to exile the Coptic Church  as a  punishment for its refusal to be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dioscurus  didn't  quite go the extra  mile to  make the  point that  Copts  are not  monophysite, the Coptic Church has always felt a mandate  to reconcile ""semantic"" differences between all  Christian  Churches.   This is   aptly  expressed by the  current  117th successor  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  ""To the  Coptic Church, faith is more  important  than  anything, and   others  must know that  semantics  and terminology are of  little importance to us.""  Throughout this  century,  the Coptic Church has played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The Coptic Church is one of the founders of the World Council of Churches. It has remained a member of that  council  since 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church is  a member  of the all  African Council of Churches  (AACC)  and the  Middle East Council of  Churches (MECC).  The Church    plays an  important role   in the Christian   movement   by   conducting dialogues   aiming  at  resolving  the theological differences with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Presbyterian, and Evangelical Churches.  [...]  As a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Eastren Orthodox did sign a common statement of Christology, in which the heresey of Monophysitism was condemned. So the Coptic Orthodox Church does not believe in Monophysitism.

I appear to say that Nestorius was monophysite.  As Andrew Byler correctly stated it, the Nestorians and monophysites were actually opposite parties.  The point I was making, which Nabil explains in some detail, is that some groups that have been considered heretical probably aren't.  Chalcedon was a compromise between two groups, the Alexandrians and Antiochenes.  It adopted language that was intended to be acceptable to moderates in both camps, while ruling out the extremes.  I agree that there were extremes that were heretical.  However in the course of the complex politics of the time, it appears that some people got rejected who didn't intend heresy, but simply used language that was not understood or even was mispresented.  And some seem not to have jointed in the compromise for reasons other than doctrine.  There are groups descended from both of the supposedly heretical camps.  This posting discussed the descendants of the Alexandrians.  There are also a remaining Nestorians.  Like some of the current so-called monophysites, there is reason to believe that the current so-called Nestorians are not heretical either.  They sheltered Nestorius from what they saw as unfair treatment, but claim they did not adopt his heresies, and in fact seem to follow more moderate representatives of the Antiochene tradition.  --clh] "

The UN or the US Government? Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you? The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?  If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you?  Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation and made it all null and void..  What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble.. Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason or another, but who will give you a ""home"".. Such as Saudia Arabia or whatever.. There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it.. Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it. The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will not care.. If your worried about the US, do the same thing..  Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what ever.. Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a little bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to piss off..

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri- helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about 2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU. If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's -- which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could get under Jupiter's influence.  > Also, perihelions of Gehrels3 were: > > April  1973     83 jupiter radii > August 1970     ~3 jupiter radii  Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.

I have seen Jeff Fenholt speak and I didn't find him judgemental.  I think that the wording for that add was certainly inappropriate, but I think they were trying to say that headbangers would like the program.

Charley,  I can't help but notice that you have still failed to provide answers to substantive questions that have been raised in response to your previous posts.  I submit that you don't answer them because you cannot answer them without running afoul of your own logic, and I once again challenge you to prove me wrong.  To make the task as easy for you as possible, I'll present concise re-statements of some of the questions that you have failed to answer, in the hope that you may address them one at a time for all to see.  Should you fail to answer again within a reasonable time period, I will re-post this article, with suitable additions and deletions, at such time that I notice a post by you on another topic.  I will repeat this procedure until you either address the outstanding challenges or you cease to post to this newsgroup.  I would like to apologize in advance if you have answered any of these questions previously and your answer missed my notice.  If you can be kind enough to re-post or e-mail such articles, I will be only too pleased to publicly rescind the challenge in question, and remove it from this list.  Now, to the questions...  1. After claiming that all atheists fit into neat psychological patterns that you proposed, then semi-retracting that claim by stating that you weren't referring to *all* atheists, I asked you to name some atheists who you feel don't fit your patterns, to show that you indeed were not referring to all atheists that you are aware of.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you name any a.a posters who do not fit into your stereotype?  Here is the context for the question:  >>> This is not true for everyone on this board, and you are out of line >>> in assuming that it is. >> >>YOU, however, deleted the text further along where I said that I didn't mean >>to imply that everybody's experience was along the same lines. > >Whether or not you *mean* to make such implications, you do so >repeatedly. > >Allow me to approach the issue from another viewpoint: can you name >those atheists that you've come across who *do not* fit into the >patterns that you theorize?   2. You have taken umbrage to statements to the effect that ""senses and reason are all we have to go by"", and when pressed, you have implied that we have an alternative called revelation.  I have repeatedly asked you to explain what revelation is and how one can both experience and interpret revelation without doing so via our senses and reason.  You failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Can you explain what is revelation and how one can experience and interpret it without using senses and inherent reasoning?  Here is the context for the question:  >>Revelation is not reason, and if we DO have revelation, then >>reasoning is NOT all we have.  >First, show me that revelation exists.  Second, if revelation is not >perceived through the senses, how exactly is it perceived?  According >to my Webster's, revelation is ""an act of revealing or communicating >divine truth.""  Now, tell me how such a thing can be revealed/ >communicated other than via the senses?

I challenge you to show me otherwise.  then later...  >>Few mystics will agree to this assertion, and the common defense of >>redefining ""senses"" to absorb (for instance) mystical experiences is >>begs the question of whether some senses are better than others. > >I allow you the broadest definition of senses, to make things easier >for you.  Now, show me that ""mystical experiences"" exist.  Remember, >you aren't allowed to go by testimony of others (e.g., mystics), since >you have dismissed my testimony as unreliable - you know, tainted by >my own bias.

If you cannot do so, you >might as well give up the fight.  then later...  >Let me reiterate, you have NOT explained your interpretation of your >experiences, so it is not possible for me to have attacked them.  In >point of fact, I specifically challenged you to explain this >revelation stuff that you were talking about, and I note for the >record that you appear to have declined my challenge. > >*What* is it?  *How* is it sensed?  *How* is it interpreted?  And >*how* does this sensing and interpretation occur without the conduit >of our senses and reasoning abilities?  You have answered none of >these questions that go straight to the heart of your claims.  If you >can't answer them, your claims are entirely specious.   3.  You have stated that all claims to dispassionate analysis made by a.a posters are unverifiable and fantastical.  I asked you to identify one such claim that I have made.  You have failed to do so.  Please do so now.  Question: Have I made any claims at all that are unverifiable and fantastical?  If so, please repeat them.  Here is the context for the question:   >>I must thank David Wood a most sensitive and intelligent (if wrong :-)) >>posting.  then later...  >>Likewise, the reference to ""unverifiable, fantastical >>claims"" represents fairly accurately my reaction to all of the claims to >>dispassionate analysis that are repeated in this group. > >Give me your address and I'll be pleased to send you a dictionary. >Failing that, can you name ONE claim that I have made that is in any >sense unverifiable or fantastical?  I demand that you retract this >statement if you cannot offer up evidence.  If you follow your usual >pattern of ignoring the challenge, then you are simply an asshole.   4.  First you dismissed claims by atheists that they became atheists as a result of reason, then later you stated that if one accepted the ""axioms"" of reason that one couldn't help but become atheist.  I asked you to explain the contradiction.  Your only response was a statement that the question was incoherent, an opinion not shared by others that I have asked, be they atheist or theist.  You have failed to answer the question.  Please do so now.  Question: Do you retract your claim that a.a posters have not become atheists as a result of reason, despite their testimony to that effect?  If you don't retract that claim, do you retract the subsequent claim that acceptance of the axioms of reason inevitably result in atheism?  Here is the context for the question:  [First quote] >>...we have here a bunch of people who claim that their position is >>based on reason... it is up to atheists to prove it to me... > >then, > [Second quote] >>...but I do not see how one can accept these axioms and not end up with >>an atheistic point of view.   5.  First, you claimed that you would (probably) not answer these Challenges because they contained too much in the way of ""included text"" from previous posts.  Later, you implied that you wouldn't respond because I was putting words in your mouth.  Please clarify this seeming contradiction.  Question:  Do you prefer to respond to Challenges that include context from your own posts, or that I paraphrase your positions in order to avoid ""included text""?  Here is the context for the question:  First you said:  >>My ordinary rules are that I don't read articles over over 150 lines >>or articles in which there is nothing but included text on the first >>screen.  THese are not rules of morality, but practicality.  then later...  >>If someone is not going to argue with MY version of MY position, then >>they cannot be argued with.

sci.space	" From: buenneke@monty.rand.org (Richard Buenneke) Subject: DC-X Rollout Report X-Added: Forwarded by Space Digest Organization: [via International Space University] Original-Sender: isu@VACATION.VENARI.CS.CMU.EDU Distribution: sci Lines: 124   McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X  HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO) rocket ship.  The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in mid-June.  Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60 million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies.  SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.  SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies, said Col.  Simon ""Pete"" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program. ""I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I have available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell Douglas Astronautics headquarters.  While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the ""better, faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead of evolutionary technology developments.  Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a ""build a little, test a little"" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months -- showed how today's engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of our parents' time.""  ""The key is management,"" Worden said. ""SDIO had a very light hand on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.""  Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be crucial. ""It's essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially.""  SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the House Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""This is the direction we're going to have to go,"" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's Democratic chairman. ""Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.""  Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further. Joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,"" Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency.  Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""Let's not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!""  Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.  McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment. ""On very large ventures, companies put in seed money,"" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas' senior vice president for space systems. ""You need strong government investments.""  While the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).  Flight tests this summer at White Sands will ""expand the envelope"" of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to 5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000 feet.  Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final tests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.  The flight test series will be supervised by Charles ""Pete"" Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing. Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.  If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of thrust  Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround.  Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union. The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.  The mechanism for the teaming may already be in place.  Pratt has a technology agreement with NPO Energomash, the design bureau responsible for the tri-propellant and Energia cryogenic engines.   "

Maybe cyclical is not the best word.  That is one aspect of it.  In the case of the virgin birth prophecy, it applied to the then and there, and also prophetically to Christ.  The army that threatened the king would cease to be a threat in a very short time.  Yet it also prophecied of Christ.  Several prophecies that refered to Christ also had application at the time they were made.  ""Out of Egypt have I called my Son"" refers both to Israel, and prophetically to Christ.   ""Why do the heathen rage"" was said of David and also of Christ.  Another example would be the Scripture quoted of Judas, ""and his bishoprick let another take.""

Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.  Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.  Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a potential to power the globe.  For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.  The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever increasing demand using proven, basic technology.  OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the National Space Society, which is an international non-profit organization that promotes development of the space frontier.

The concept of a closed canon would >certainly cast a shadow on contemporary prophets.  On the other hand, >an open canon seems to be indicated sometimes. >  Let's get back to basics.  Canon (from the latin) means a rule.  If we say that a rule is open then its a rule made to be broken. There is an issue also of measurement against a rule.  Thus the words that are spoken need to be compared against the rule/canon but not added to the canon.  Is new revelation necessary?  Topical, current, personal revelation I'd say is necessary.  New revelation for all people for all times is not necessary as we have that in Scripture.  You also seem to confuse canon with scripture.  Scripture may speak of itself being open - ie God speaking today.  It would speak that it is closed in the sense that the canon is unchangeable.  (Though the concept of canon is later historically.)  >Also interesting to note is that some so called prophecies are nothing new >but rather an inspired translation of scripture.  Is it right to call >that prophecy?  Misleading?  Wouldn't that be more having to do with >knowledge?

If prophecy is meant to encourage, exhort or correct then is an overlap with scripture.  If prophecy is meant to bring a `word' of the form ""the man you live with is not your husband"" then that is knowledge.  Yet the exact words their are scripture. I would expect the difference to be the motive and means for delivery. The reading of scripture itself can be a powerful force.

What I was asking is this:  Please show me that the most effective substance-absure recovery programs involve meetinsg peoples' spiritual needs, rather than merely attempting to fill peoples' spiritual needs as percieved by the people, A.A, S.R.C. regulars, or snoopy. This will probably involve defining ""spritual needs"" (is it not that clear) and showing that such things exist and how they can be filled.  Annother tack you might take is to say that ""fulfilling spiritual needs"" means ""acknowledging a ""higher power"" of some sort, then show that systems that do require this, work better than otherwise identical systems that do not. A correlation here would help you, but as you point out this might just be demonstrating swapping one crutch for annother. (however, I do feel that religion is usually a better crutch than alchohol, as it is not usually poisonous! :) )  I hope with that clarification, my question will be answerable.

Between Adam and Eve and Golgotha the whole process of the fall of man occurred.  This involved a gradual dimming of consciousness of the spiritual world.  This is discernable in the world outlooks of different peoples through history.  The Greek, for example, could say, ""better a beggar in the land of the living than a king in the land of the dead."" (Iliad, I think).  The question of what happens to human beings who died before Christ is an ever present one with Christians.  I am not ready to conscign Adam or Abraham, or even Cain to eternal damnation.  Yet they all died in their sins, in the Christian sense.  The same can be said of the whole of  Gentile humanity, and also of the unrepentant malefactor on the cross next to him.  I do not limit the power of Christ to save even him, through whom Satan would mock his deed of salvation at the very moment of its fulfillment.  >In my studies >of the ancient mystery reliegions, I have run across many poems or rituals or >what nots with the interpretation that those who are of God will be with Him >via the promised seed but those who rebel will suffer *eternal* life in dieing. > It was a standard belief back then.  It is possible to experience eternity in a passing moment.  The relationship of eternity to duration is not simply one of indefinitely extended conditions of Greenwich mean time. It is possible to imagine an eternity of agony or bliss - or even many of them - in the spiritual world during the time between earthly death and a new birth.  It was also a standard belief among many peoples that even the righteous were lost. This again is the result of the loss of the paradisal consciousness that fled from us after the fall, with our ever increasing involvement with the sense world.  It would be interesting to share in the results of your studies of ancient people's ideas of life after death.  >                                    Today we think we know so much and that >if we could go back in time we could sure teach those people a thing or two. >But I think that as this age has grown older that it is we who opperate from a >mist, not those of the older ages. >  Mankind fell into mist and darkness, and at ""the turning point of time"" a new light entered into the world.  The light still grows, and we are developing the eyes with which to see by it.  Much new revelation and growth in under- standing lies before us.  Our new vision and understanding is still very feeble, but it contains something new that will grow in time to embrace that which is old and much more as well.  (At this point I should acknowledge openly my debt to the work of Rudolf Steiner, founder of Anthroposophy, for  many insights that have led me to my views on this subject).  >I have said it before, I'd love to post on this but the vulcan hammer would >fall.

I think it was much less abstract and much more real and spiritually concrete, a teaching that struck much closer to home than our doctrines or teachings today can be received.  I am not so ready to attribute widespread notions in antiquity to simple dispersion from an original source.  Even if they were passed on, the question is, to what extent did they reflect real perception and experience?  The similarity in the midst of great variety of expression of the different people's ideas of the time immediately after death testifies to the presence of an underlying reality.  In any case, we study geometry not by reading old manuscripts of Euclid, but by contemplating the principles themselves.  On the other hand, there is one notion firmly embedded in Christianity that originated most definitely in a pagan source.  The idea that the human being consists essentially of soul only, and that the soul is created at birth, was consciously adopted from Aristotle, whose ideas dominated Christian thought for fifteen hundred years and still does today. He was at once the father of modern thought and at the same time lived during that darkened time when the perception of our eternal spiritual being had grown dim.  >maybe at sometime in the future-  Indeed. I should also clarify that I do not deny that eternal irrevocable damnation is a real possibility.  But the narrow range in which we conceive of the decisive moment, i.e. after the end of a single earthly life, is not in my mind sufficient to embrace the reality, and I think that is why the early creeds were couched in terms that did not try to spell it out.  >Rex  Gerry (73237.2006@compuserve.com) "

Okay... I argued this thoroughly about 3-4 weeks ago.  Men and women are different ... physically, physiologically, and psychologically.  Much recent evidence for this statement is present in the book ""Brainsex"" by Anne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it. Their book is an overview of recent scientific research on this topic and is well referenced.  Now, if women and men are different in some ways, the law can only adequately take into account their needs in these areas where they are different by also taking into account the ways in which men and women are different.  Maternity leave is an example of this -- it takes into account that women get pregnant.  It does not give women the same rules it would give to men, because to treat women like it treats men in this instance would be unjust.  This is just simply an obvious example of where men and women are intrinsically different!!!!!  Now, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression. However, maternity leave is sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. Men do not have the same access to leave that women do (not to the same extent or degree), and therefore IT IS SEXIST.  No matter however much a man _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And therefore the law IS SEXIST.  No man can have access to maternity leave, NO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIES TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope this is clear.  Maternity leave is an example where a sexist law is just, because the sexism here just reflects the ""sexism"" of nature in making men and women different.  There are many other differences between men and women which are far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I recommend you have a look at the book ""Brainsex"".  Your point that perhaps some day men can also be pregnant is fallacious. If men can one day become pregnant it will be by having biologically become women!  To have a womb and the other factors required for pregnancy is usually wrapped up in the definition of what a woman is -- so your argument, when it is examined, is seen to be fallacious.  You are saying that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that women can have if they also become women -- which actually just supports my statement that maternity leave is sexist.  >The discrimination comes in when a woman is denied opportunities >because of her (legally determined) sexual inferiorities.  As I >understand most religious sexual discrimination, and I doubt that >Islam is exceptional, the female is not allowed into the priestly >caste and in general is subjugated so that she has no aspirations to >rights which, as an equal human, she ought to be entitled to.  There is no official priesthood in Islam -- much of this function is taken by Islamic scholars.  There are female Islamic scholars and female Islamic scholars have always existed in Islam.  An example from early Islamic history is the Prophet's widow, Aisha, who was recognized in her time and is recognized in our time as an Islamic scholar.  >No matter how sweetly you coat it, part of the role of religions >seems, historically, to have served the function of oppressing the >female, whether by forcing her to procreate to the extent where >there is no opportunity for self-improvement, or by denying her >access to the same facilities the males are offered.  You have no evidence for your blanket statement about all religions, and I dispute it.  I could go on and on about women in Islam, etc., but I recently reposted something here under the heading ""Islam and Women"" -- if it is still at your news-site I suggest you read it.

Your statement that ""other religions are no different"" is, I think, a statement based simply on lack of knowledge about religions other than Christianity and perhaps Judaism.  >I'll accept your affirmation that Islam grants women the same rights >as men when you can show me that any muslim woman can aspire to the >same position as (say) Khomeini and there are no artificial religious >or social obstacles on her path to achieve this.

soc.religion.christian	" From: mangoe@cs.umd.edu (Charley Wingate) Subject: Re: Was Jesus Black? Lines: 45  This subject seems to be incredibly inflammatory.  Those who subscribe to _Biblical Archaeology Review_ will remember a spectacular letter battle set off when someone complained about a Franklin Mint ad.  (_BAR_ is a great magazine, but the contrast between the rather scholarly articles and the incredibly sleazy ads is extreme.)  In this ad, they were hawking a doll with a head based on the famous bust of Nefertiti, giving the face a typical doll-pink complexion. The letter complained about this as a misrepresentation on the grounds that Nefertiti was ""a beautiful black queen.""  This set off an exchange of hotheaded letters than ran for several issues, to the point where they had an article from an Egyptologist titled ""Was Cleopatra Black?""  (The answer to the title is ""no""-- she was greek.)  I have to say that I hear a hysterical note in much of the complaining.  I personally have seen only one blond-haired Jesus (in the National Shrine in Wash. DC), and I found it very jarring.  Western representations vary enourmously, but in general the image of is of a youngish male with dark hair and beard, of a sort that can be found (modulo the nose) all up and down the Mediterranean.  (Also, if what I remember is correct, the ""Black Madonna"" doesn't represent a person with negroid features.  It is black because of an accident.  Joe Buehler....?)  In the presence of all those marble statues, one is prone to forget that greeks are rather likely to have black hair.  When one crosses the bosporus, the situation breaks down completely.  Are Turks white?  How about Persians, or various groups in the indian subcontinent?  Was Gandhi white?  How about the Arabs?  Or picture Nassar and Sadat standing side by side.  And then there are the Ethiopians....  Those of a white racist bent are not likely to say that *any* of these people are ""white"" (i.e., of the racist's ""race"").  If I may risk a potentially inflammatory remark, one undercurrent of this seems to be the identification of modern jews as members of the oppressor race.  Considering the extreme dicotomy between medieval religion on the one hand and medieval antisemitism on the other, I don't think that this ""Jesus was white"" thesis ever played the roles that some hold it did.  Representations of Jesus as black or korean or whatever are fine.  It seems awfully self-serving to insist that Jesus belongs to one's own racial group. -- C.

Jim,  There are a couple of things about your post and others in this thread that are a little confusing. An atheist is one for whom all things can be understood as processes of nature - exclusively. There is no need for any recourse to Divnity to describe or explain anything. There is no purpose or direction for any event beyond those required by physics, chemistry, biology, etc.; everything is random, nothing is determnined. This would also have to include human intelligence of course and all its products. There is nothing requiring that life evolve or that it acquire intelligence, it's just a happy accident. For an atheist, no event can be preferred to another or be said to have more or less value than another in any naturalistic sense, and no thought -about- an event can have value. The products of our intelligence are acquired from our environment, from teaching, training, observation and experience and are only significant to the individual mind wherein they reside. These mental processes and the images they produce for us are just electrical activity and nothing more; content is of no consequence. The human mind is as much a response to natural forces as water running down a hill. How then can an atheist judge value? What is the basis for criticizing the values ennumerated in the Bible or the purposes imputed to God? On what grounds can the the behavior of the reliogious be condemned? It seems that, in judging the values that motivate others to action, you have to have some standard against which conduct is measured, but what in nature can serve that purpose? What law of nature can you invoke to establish your values. Since every event is entirely and exclusively a physical event, what difference could it possibly make what -anyone- does, religious or otherwise, there can be no -meaning- or gradation of value. The only way an atheist can object to -any- behaviour is to admit that the objection is entirely subjective and that he(she) just doesn't like it - that's it. Any value judgement must be prefaced by the disclaimer that it is nothing more than a matter of personal opinion and carries no weight in any ""absolute"" sense. That you don't like what God told people to do says nothing about God or God's commands, it says only that there was an electrical event in your nervous system that created an emotional state that your mind coupled with a pre-existing thought-set to form that reaction. That your objections -seem- well founded is due to the way you've been conditioned; there is no ""truth"" content. The whole of your intellectual landscape is an illusion, a virtual reality. I didn't make these rules, it's inherent in naturalistic atheism and to be consistent, you have to accept the non-significance of any human thought, even your own. All of this being so, you have excluded yourself from any discussion of values, right, wrong, goood, evil, etc. and cannot participate. Your opinion about the Bible can have no weight whatsoever.

TYPE: ====  The group will be MODERATED for orderly and free religious dialo- gue.   The moderation will NOT prevent disagreement or dissent to beliefs, but will mainly be used  to  prevent  derogatory/squalid use  of  dialect  and irrelevant issues. The moderators have been decided through personal e-mail and through a  general  consensus among  the proponants by discussion in news.groups. The following moderators have been proposed and agreed upon:  Moderator:     Nabeel A. Rana  (rana@rintintin.colorado.edu) Co-Moderator:  Dr. Tahir Ijaz  (ijaz@ccu.umanitoba.ca)    A BRIEF DESCRIPTION ABOUT AHMADIYYA/ISLAM: =========================================   The Ahmadiyya Movement in Islam, an international organi- sation, was founder in 1989 in Qadian, India. The founder of this sect, Hazrat Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1835-1908), proclaimed to be the Promised Reformer of this age as foretold in almost all the major religions of the world today (Islam, Christianity, Judiasm,  Hin- duism).  He  claimed  to  be  the  long awaited second comming of Jesus Christ (metaphorically), the Muslim Mahdi, and the Promised Messiah.  He  claimed that the prophecies contained in almost all the great religions of the world about the advent of a  messenger from God have been fulfilled.  The claims Hazrat Ahmad raised storms  of  hostility  and extreme  oposition from many priestlike people of Muslims, Chris- tians, Jews and Hindus of that age. Such opposition is often wit- nessed  in  the history of divine reformers. Even today this sect is being persecuted specially in  some  of  the  Muslim  regimes. Dispite  the  opposition  and persecution, this sect has won many adherents in 130 countries. It has over 10 million followers, who come from a diverse ethnic and cultural background.  The sect is devoted to world peace and in bringing  about a better understanding of religion, and the founders of all reli- gions. Its mission is to unite mankind into one Universal  broth- erhood  and  develop  a  better  understanding  of  faith. Ahmadi Muslims have always been opposed to all kind of violence and spe- cially religious intollerance and fundamentalism.  Among its many philanthropic activities, the sect has es- tablished  a network of hundreds of schools, hospitals, and clin- ics in many third world countries. These institutions are staffed by  volunteer  professional  and are fully financed by the sect's internal resources.  The Ahmadiyya mission is to bring about a universal moral reform,  establish  peace and justice, and to unite mankind under one universal religion.   NEWSGROUP CREATION: ==================  When the Call For Votes is called,  the  discussion  will officially  end.   Voting  will be held for about three weeks. If the group gets 2/3rd majority AND  100  more  ""YES/Create""  votes than  ""NO/don't  create""  votes;  the group shall be created. Any questions or comments  may  be  included  in  the  discussion  or directly sent to: rana@rintintin.colorado.edu "

Organization: University of Alaska Lines: 31   I used to be a marriage commissioner for the Alaska Court System (sort of a justice of the peace).  I had great difficulty with that duty.  I used to pray earnestly in the courthouse bathroom before the ceremonies, mostly asking that the couples would come to appreciate and fulfill the true holiness and divine purpose in marriage--couples who obviously didn't realize that marriage is God's institution, not the state's.  Gradually, however, I came to conclude that because I was acting in a strictly secular, public capacity, established as such by both the state and the expectations of the couples involved, I was really conducting a purely secular, legal civil event, with no greater moral or religious implications than if I had been conducting a civil trial (the couple who told me, mid-ceremony, to ""please hurry it up"" may have helped me to this conclusion).  I thought I had neatly rationalized a clear and sharp distinction between marriage before God, and ""marriage"" before the state, until I had to deal with my own divorce.  Keeping Matthew 19:6 in mind, I felt that the state had no business dissolving my marriage established before God, but of course it assumed jurisdiction nonetheless.  I would ask those of you proposing answers to this question to consider this issue's logical extension: If intercourse, or the mental intent of the parties, or the ceremony of the church, or any combination thereof, establishes marriage, then at what moment is it dissolved?

soc.religion.christian	" From: trajan@cwis.unomaha.edu (Stephen McIntyre) Subject: Theists And Objectivity Organization: University of Nebraska at Omaha Lines: 90  Can a theist be truly objective?  Can he be impartial when questioning the truth of his scriptures, or will he assume the superstition of his parents when questioning?  I've often found it to be the case that the theist will stick to some kind of superstition when wondering about God and his scriptures.  I've seen it in the Christian, the Jew, the Muslim, and the other theists alike.  All assume that their mothers and fathers were right in the aspect that a god exists, and with that belief search for their god.  Occasionally, the theist may switch religions or aspects of the same religion, but overall the majority keep to the belief that some ""Creator"" was behind the universe's existence.  I've known Muslims who were once Christians and vice versa, I've known Christians who were once Jewish and vice versa, and I've even known Christians who become Hindu.  Yet, throughout their transition from one faith to another, they've kept this belief in some form of higher ""being.""  Why?  It usually all has to do with how the child is brought up.  From the time he is born, the theist is brought up with the notion of the ""truth"" of some kind of scripture-- the Bible, the Torah, the Qur'an, & etc.  He is told of this wondrous God who wrote (or inspired) the scripture, of the prophets talked about in the scripture, of the miracles performed, & etc. He is also told that to question this (as children are apt to do) is a sin, a crime against God, and to lose belief in the scrip- ture's truth is to damn one's soul to Hell. Thus, by the time he is able to read the scripture for himself, the belief in its ""truth"" is so ingrained in his mind it all seems a matter of course.  But it doesn't stop there.  Once the child is able to read for himself, there is an endeavor to inculcate the child the ""right"" readings of scripture, to concentrate more on the pleasant readings, to gloss over the worse ones, and to explain away the unexplainable with ""mystery."" Circular arguments, ""self-evdent"" facts and ""truths,"" unreasoning belief, and fear of hell is the meat of religion the child must eat of every day.  To doubt, of course, means wrath of some sort, and the child must learn to put away his brain when the matter concerns God. All of this has some considerable effect on the child, so that when he becomes an adult, the superstitions he's been taught are nearly impossible to remove.  All of this leads me to ask whether the theist can truly be objective when questioning God, Hell, Heaven, the angels, souls, and all of the rest. Can he, for a moment, put aside this notion that God *does* exist and look at everything from a unbiased point of view?  Obviously, most theists can somewhat, especially when presented with ""mythical gods"" (Homeric, Roman, Egyptian, & etc.).  But can they put aside the assumption of God's existence and question it impartially?

What the so-called ""eco-freaks"" want to do is to simply bring those fees in line with current economic reality.  Currently, mining companies can get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices -- something like $50!  The mining lobby has for decades managed to block any reform of these outdated fees.  In fact, the latest attempt to reform them was again blocked -- President Clinton ""compromised"" by taking the mining fee reforms out of his '94 budget, and plans to draft separate legislation to fight that battle.

I think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.  The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king, who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million, His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual, seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of slots.  The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside). According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and the Pacific Rim.  RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money. Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time. Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way that people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything."" Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.  Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually, he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.  The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners :-)  Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1 million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place now.  Tidbits:  *  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big business because big business is just like what they have over there, except that ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""  *  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months.  *  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia, and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.  *  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying monolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.  *  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting 25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government.  *  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites, which was rather reassuring.  *  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition, shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date hardware.  -- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ""Find a way or make one."" -attributed to Hannibal "

About judgment, on the other hand, St. Paul 1 Cor 5:12) urges Christians to judge their fellow Christians. Following the Apostle's teaching, I judge that you should reconsider returning to the Christian fold and embrace the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.  He is the God who lives.  Concerning what you were told about non-believers when you were a catholic, that is true.  As I have posted before, Vatican II (Lumen Gentium, II, n. 16) teaches: ""Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or His Chruch, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and moved by grace, try in their actions to do His will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.""  Responding to your solicitation for opinions on the thinking processes of God, the best I can do is refer you to Scripture.  Scripture is one of the best sources for learning what can be known about God.

In my encounters with Christians, I find myself dismayed by their belief that their faith is total truth.  According to them, their beliefs come from the Bible and the bible is the word of God and God is truth - thus they know the truth.  This stance makes it difficult to discuss other faiths with them and my own hesitations about Christianity because they see no other way. Their way is the 'truth.'  But I see their faith arising from a willful choice to believe a particular way.  That choice is part faith and part reason, but it seems to me a choice.  My discussions with some Christians remind me of schoolyard discussions when I was in grade school:  A kid would say, ""All policemen are jerks!""  I'd ask, ""How do you know?""  ""Because my daddy told me so!""  ""How do you know you're daddy is right?""  ""He says he's always right!""  Well the argument usually stops right there.  In the end, aren't we all just kids, groping for the truth?

I can understand criticisms of Christianity that say there's not enough evidence to believe it, or that there's just as good evidence for other religions.  I don't agree, but clearly there are plenty of intelligent people who don't find the evidence convincing.  But that doesn't seem to be your point.  Rather, you seem upset that people who believe Christianity is true also believe that things which contradict it are false.  This suggests a model of spiritual things that's rather different than the Christian one.  It sounds more like an existentialist view, where people choose what value to follow, but there's no actual independent spiritual reality, and so no way to say that a specific choice is in some unique sense right.  This sort of model -- with modifications of one sort or another -- may be appropriate for some religions.  But Christianity is in its essense a ""historical"" religion.  That is, it's based on the concept that there are actual spiritual entities out there, that one of them has intervened in history in specific ways, and that we see evidence of that in history.  In the ""mundane"" world, we are not free to choose how things work.  When we drop something, it falls (aside from well-defined situations where it doesn't).  The Christian concept is that spiritual matters, there is also an actual external reality.  I hope we're all honest enough not to claim that we have perfect understanding.  But while we may not think we know everything, we are confident that we know some things.  And that implies that we think things that contradict them are false.  I don't see how else we could proceed.  This needn't result in arrogance.  I'm certainly interested in talking with people of other religions.  They may have things to teach me, and even if they don't, I respect them as fellow human beings.  But it's got to be possible to respect people and also think that on some matters they are wrong.  Maybe even disasterously wrong.  --clh] "

Andrew,  How I wish this were true, and how I long for the day in which it will be true.  But alas, it is not true of history.  The Bible does not have a message -- it has messages.

Like the isrealites order to wipe out other tribes including women and children down to cattle, and punished severely when they were less than complete about the job.

Have these been misunderstood?  I think not.  They have only been understood too clearly.  It is essential that christians grasp firmly the good the bible teaches, the meek carpenter from Nazareth is a potent symbol for how we should be, his teachings we must take to heart, but we cannot ignore the other material in the bible which is not to our liking and say those who live by that have misread it.  To say that is only to chose a point of interpretation and declare it normative.  Such can be done with the same legitmacy by anyone.  Instead we must let the text critique the text.

In fact, be- fore BATSE, having this widely separated ""Interplanetary Network"" was the only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot locate a burst (except to say ""It's somewhere in the field of view."").  With two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors, one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the sky), voila, you have an error box.  BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination, but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde- pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.  You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe (in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.

The reason I dropped philosphy as my major was because I ran into too many pharisaical Simon's.  I don't know how many walking encyclopedia's I ran across in philosphy classes.  The problem isn't in knowing sooooo much more than your average lay person, the problem comes when you become puffed up about it. Schaeffer is just fine for the average lay person.  That was who he was writting to.  I suppose that you would have criticised John that his gospel was to simple.  I've talked with Schaeffer one on one.  I've been in lectures with the man when he was being drilled by philosphy students and prof's from secular as well as Christian universities. (ND alone would fill both those catagories) His answers were enough that the prof's themselves often were taken back and caused to re-think what their question was.  I saw this time and time again at different open forums.  So yes, Schaeffers books are by in large, well, simplistic.  It certainly isn't grad level reading.  But we must get off our high horses when it comes to recommended reading.  Do you seriously think most people would get through the first chapter of Wittgenstein?  I may have more to say about this secular scientist at another time.  Also, one must finally get beyond the doubt caused by *insistent* inquisitiveness.  One cannot live his life constantly from a cartisian doubt base.  Look, the Christian wholeheartedly supports genuine rationality.  But we must add a qualification to give this balance.  Christianity is second to none in keeping reason in its place.  We never know the value of a thing until we know its limits.  Put unlimited value on something and in the end you will exhaust it of all value!  THis is why Xianity is thoroughly rational but not the least bit rationalistic. It also explains the curious fact that it is rationalism, and not Christian faith, which leads to irrationality.  If we forget the limits of a thing, we fly in the face of reality and condem ourselves to learn the simple ironic lesson of life:  ""More without limits is less;  less with limits is more.""  Or as I have so often stated it, freedom without form soon becomes form w/o freedom.  Let's put it another way.  The rationality of faith is implacably opposed to absurdity but has no quarrel with mystery. Think about that.  It can tell the difference between the two if you will let it.  Christianity's contention with rationalism is not that it has too much reason in it, but that it has very little else.  When a Christian comes to faith his understanding and his trust go hand in hand, but as he continues in faith his trust may sometimes be called to go on by itself without his understanding.  This is where the principle of suspended judgment applies.  At such time if the Christian faith is to be itself and let God be God, it must suspend judgment and say, ""Father I do not understand you but I trust you.""  Now don't read all your objections of me into that statement.  I wasn't saying I do not understand you at all, but I trust you anyway."" It means that ""I do not understand You *in this situation* but I do understand *why I trust You* anyway""  Therefore I can trust that you understand even though I do not. The former is a mystery unrelieved by rationality and indistinguishable from absurdity.  The latter is a statement of rationality of faith walking hand in hand with the mystery of Faith.  So.... the principle of suspended judgment is not irrational.  It is not a leap of faith but a walk of faith.  As believers we cannot always know why, but we canalways know why we trust God who knows why and this makes all the difference.  Now, there is one obvious snag to all this and this is where I have parted company with philosophy- what is eminently reasonable in theory is a rather bit more difficult in practice.  In practice the pressure of mystery acts on faith like the insistent ""whying"" of a 3 year old.  It isn't just that we would like to know what we do not know but that we feel we *must* know what we cannot know.  The one produces frustration because curiosity is denied; the other leads to genuine anguish.  More specifically the poorer our understanding is in coming to faith the more necessary it will be to understand everything after coming to faith.  If we do not know why we trust God, then we will always need to know exactly what God is doing in order to trust him.  Failing to grasp that, we may not be able to trust him, for anything we do not understand may count decisevely against what we are able to trust.  If, on the other hand, we do know why we trust God, we will be able to trust him in situations where we do not understand what He is doing. (Too many Xian leaders teach as if the Christian had a window in the back of his head which allows for understanding at every foot fall)  For what God is doing may be ambiguous, but it will not be inherently contradictory!  It may be mystery to us, but mystery is only inscrutable; what would be insufferable is absurdity. And that my friend, was the conclusion of Nietzche both in theory and in practice.  --Rex "

I find that I am dissatisfied with the little purposes that we can manufacture for ourselves.  Little in the cosmic sense.  Even the greatest of the great pharos are long gone, the pyramids historical oddities being worn down by the wind, eventually to be turned into dust. Mankind itself will one day perish.  Without some interconnectedness that transcends the physical, without God, it is all pointless in the end.  Most people are able to live with that, and for them little purposes (success, money, power, effecting change, helping others) suffice.  I suppose they never  think about the cosmic scale, or are at least able to put it out of their minds.  To me, it is comforting to know that reality is an illusion.  That the true reality underneath the the physical is spirit.  That this world is a school of sorts, where we learn and grow, and our souls mature.  That gives a purpose to my little purposes, and takes some of the pressure off.  It's not so necessary to make this life a success in human terms if you're really just here to learn.  It's more important to progress, grow, persist, to learn to love yourself and others and to express your love, especially when it's dificult to do so.

Lines: 117 Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: rocket.sw.stratus.com   A new alternative to Scouting for those ""unacceptable to BSA"" for reasons of religious or sexual preference:   From: ""BOYD R. CRITZ, III"" <71611.365@CompuServe.COM> Subject: EnviroLeague  ""Birth Announcement"" on March 7, 1993, from EARTH Forum, CompuServe Information Service ===================================================================  FORMAL ANNOUNCEMENT -------------------  (SM) EnviroLeague  A new youth movement,""EnviroLeague,"" was recently born, according to its founder, Boyd R. Critz, III (CIS ID# 71611,365), of Peoria, Illinois. EnviroLeague exists for the education of youth, both male and female, in matters concerning their values related to and responsibility for our environment.  Incorporated as an Illinois not-for-profit corporation, its Articles and initial applications for a service mark have now been filed.  According to Critz, its draft Bylaws contain the following statement of Mission and Objectives:  MISSION  It is the Mission of EnviroLeague and its adult members to foster and implement the improved education of young people in the need to conduct their lives as Stewards of The Earth, to leave The Earth in a better condition than they found it, and to otherwise act as responsible, moral and ethical users of their environment.  To pursue the accomplishment of this Mission, EnviroLeague shall seek to serve as a catalyst, focusing in common cause the separate efforts of all groups desiring the preservation, improvement, and responsible use of the environment in which we must all live.  OBJECTIVES  In pursuit of the Mission of EnviroLeague, its primary objectives shall be: (1)  To establish a Movement involving as many environmentally concerned organizations as possible, said Movement having as its primary focus the education and participatory involvement of young people in appropriate areas of environmental concern; (2)  To develop and provide to such organizations and their branches a full complement of program materials for their use, including suitable uniforms, insignia and other badges, written ideas, syllabi and information, literature and other items as shall seem appropriate and desirable; (3)  To serve as a ""clearing house"" for the exchange of program ideas, materials and information among said organizations;  and (4)  To assist environmentally concerned organizations to recruit and train the necessary adult leadership for their youth programs.  EnviroLeague will operate through three ""Program Divisions"" serving youth in the elementary, middle and high school grades, respectively.  Service shall be through formation of ""EnviroLeague Teams,"" either by EnviroLeague itself or by environmentally conscious organizations (or their local branches) wishing a charter to use programs developed by EnviroLeague.  EnviroLeague, as it develops, will be controlled by the actual adult leaders of each local Team, and will have no nationally imposed obstacles to membership or adult leadership status not based upon relevant improper conduct. Organizations accepting a charter may, however, impose certain additional standards for their own use of the program material.  Should such organizations do so, EnviroLeague will commit itself to forming, as soon as possible, new nearby Teams having no such restrictions, particularly as to youth membership.  EnviroLeague will operate on the principle that youth will have much to contribute to developing its programs.  Thus, the top youth leaders of its Teams for middle and high school youth may become involved in governing any local administrative groups, and those for its high school youth may be involved in similar functions at the national level.  Program materials are in development at this time.  Copies of the ""draft"" portions of the Mentor's Manual (manual for adult leadership) will be in the EARTH Forum, Library 17. These files will be updated as development takes place.  CompuServe is particularly proud that EnviroLeague's founder chose this electronic medium to make the first public announcement of its formation. This announcement is being made simultaneously in both the OUTDOOR and EARTH Forums.  The electronic home of EnviroLeague is in CompuServe's Earth Forum - GO EARTH - message and library areas 17, both named ""EnviroLeague."" ============================================================================  Subsequently, EnviroLeague's Initial Governance Council has held its first meeting.  Boyd Critz was elected as the first EnviroLeague Chief Guardian (equivalent to Chairman of the Board or CEO).  He can be reached at home (309) 675-4483 in case of real need.  Also, mail can be addressed to: EnviroLeague P.O. Box 418 Peoria, IL  61651-0418  Those interested in starting an EnviroLeague Team might just establish contact, to receive a diskette (IBM DOS, ASCII) with initial information. --  cdt@rocket.sw.stratus.com   --If you believe that I speak for my company, OR cdt@vos.stratus.com        write today for my special Investors' Packet...

This is certainly a valid objection to religion-as-explanation-of- nature.  Fortunately for the convenience of us believers, there is a class of questions that can never be reduced away by natural science.  For example: why does the universe exist at all?  After all, the time-space world didn't have to exist.  Why does *anything* exist? And: is it possible for persons (e.g. man) to come into being out of a purely impersonal cosmos?  These questions which look at the real mysteries of life -- the creation of the world and of persons -- provide a permanent indicator that the meaning of life in the material world can only be found *outside* that world, in its Source.   |> We are _just_ animals.

When you say that man is *only* an animal, I have to think that you are presenting an unprovable statement -- a dogma, if you will.  And one the requires a kind of ""faith"" too.   By taking such a hard line in your atheism, you may have stumbled into a religion of your own.  But before you write off all Christianity as phony and shallow, I hope you'll do a little research into its history and varieties, perhaps by reading Paul Johnson's ""A History of Christianity"".  From your remarks, it seems that you have been exposed to certain types of Christian religion and not others.  Even an atheist should have enough faith in Man to know that a movement of 2000 years has to have some depth, and be animated by some enduring values.

I don't meant to defend Eric Molas- I find it somewhat annoying when someone pops up on alt.atheism to tell us all about his (usually atheistic) beliefs, so I can certainly see how Christians might be annoyed- but I'd like to point out a few things.  >I am glad that I am not an atheist.  It seems tragic that some people >choose a meaningless existence.  ""no meaning from God"" is not the same as ""no meaning"". From my (atheistic) point of view, if you want meaning in your life, you get to go and get some or make some.  No free gifts of meaning. (I never quite understood how any God can just ""give"" your life meaning, actually. If he says you exists to do or be X, that gives you a purpose if you care to accept it, but is that the same thing? But I digress...)  >  How terrible to go on living only >because one fears death more than life.  This would truely be a miserably existance, which I doubt Eric endures. Life can be enjoyable, so you can live it because you like it, or purposefull, so you can live it to get something done. One should endeavour to make it so, if it is not. Otherwise it would be as you say. Terrible.  >  I feel so sorry for Eric and >yet any attempts to share my joy in life with him would be considered as >further evidence of the infectious nature of Christianity.  Probably true. Remeber he almost certainly sees that particular joy as an illusion, and does not want it. So maybe it isn't so bad?  >As a Christian I am free to be a human person.  I think, love, choose, >and create.  As an atheist, I am free to be a human person. I think, love, choose, and create.  > I will live forever with God.  Ah, now here we begin to diverge. I will not live forever with anyone.  (I don't think you will either, but you are welcome to your opinion on the matter.)  >Christ is not a kind of drug.  I tend to agree with you.  It's my opinion that (unlike drugs) religions are normal parts of human societies.  I think they have outlived their usefullness, but they are evidently quite ordinary, normal things that haven't proved lethal to humanity yet.  > Drugs are a replacement for Christ. >Those who have an empty spot in the God-shaped hole in their hearts must >do something to ease the pain.

soc.religion.christian	" From: JEK@cu.nih.gov Subject: about Eliz C Prophet Lines: 21  Rob Butera asks about a book called THE LOST YEARS OF JESUS, by Elizabeth Clare Prophet.  I do not know the book. However, Miss Prophet is the leader of a group (The Church Universal and Triumphant) derived from the I AM group founded by a Mr. Ballard who began his mission in the 1930's (I am writing this from memory and may not have all the details straight -- for an old account, check your library for a bnook by Marcus Bach) after an eighteenth-century Frenchman appeared, tapped him on the shoulder, and offered him a cup of ""cosmic essence."" A major tenet of the movement is that there is a monastery in the mountains of Tibet from which a monk descends to the lower altitudes every few centuries to preach, and that all major religions have been founded by monks from this monastery. Typically, the Ballard family and their successors, the Prophet family (related by marriage, if I remember aright), base almost all their teachings on messages they have allegedly received by telepathy from Tibet. I should be surprised if the book you mention has any scholarly basis.  Yours, James Kiefer "

One book I have which presents a fairly unbiased account of many religions is called _Man's Religions_ by John B. Noss.  It was a textbook in a class I had on comparative religion or some such thing.  It has some decent bibliographies on each chapter as a jumping off point for further reading.  It doesn't ""compare"" religions directly but describes each one individually and notes a few similarities.  But nothing I have read in it could be even remotely described as preachy or Christian based.  In fact, Christianity mercifully consumes only 90 or so of its nearly 600 pages.  The book is divided according to major regions of the world where the biggies began (India, East Asia, Near East).  There is nothing about New World religions from the Aztecs, Mayas, Incas, etc.  Just the stuff people kill each other over nowadays.  And a few of the older religions snuffed out along the way.  If you like the old stuff, then a couple of books called ""The Ancient Near East"" by James B. Pritchard are pretty cool.  Got the Epic of Gilgamesh, Code of Hammurabi, all the stuff from way back when men were gods and gods were men.  Essential reading for anyone who wishes to make up their own religion and make it sound real good.   "

I don't call it spanking because it's more of a reaction to something very dangerous, such as trying to stick their finger in a fan or running into the road.  Maybe 3-4 times for each except for the 2YO girl, who has not been spanked yet. They call it that because it *does* hurt their feelings, and of course I give all the hugs and stuff to ensure they know they're still loved.  >4.  Do you use an implement to spank with? No, that would be too painful.  If it's too traumatic they never recall why they were punished.  Besides, it must be immediate, and taking the time to go get a toolmeans you're not doing it right away, and that lessens the impact.  It's very emotional for a child as it is - which is evidenced by the fact that a little slap on the rear - which hurts for perhaps 5 seconds - is called a spanking. > >5. If you do not spank, what method of discipline do you use? Lots of logical consequences - for instance, when 4YO Matthew dared a good friend to jump out of his treehouse or he would push him out, I made sure they didn't play together for 5 days so he'd know that would make him lose friends very quickly.  He's never done anything like that since. We also use time-out in their rooms - I use a timer so they don't keep arguing with me over leaving, since it's hard to argue with a macine. I will go to the closed door and tell them timeout won't be over until they calm down if they're too tantrumy.  I use the top of the stairs when they're really young.  >6.  Your age? 40  >7.

How ere you disciplined as a kid Lots of timeouts, same as I use.  Our family and my husband's have never used spankings.  In fact, my grandmother in law was one of 11 kids, and they were almost never spanked.  This was around the turn of the century.  And, none of us has ever been afoul of the law - man-made or God's law. Jesus says, referring to a small child whom he is holding, that ""what ye do to the least of these, ye do also to me.""  The Bible also says in all things to be kind, and merciful, and especially loving. (Colossians 3:12-15.) There is no room for selfish anger, which I'll admit I've been tempted with at times.  When I've felt like spanking hard in anger, maybe the kid deserved a little slap on the rear, but what I would have given would have been the devil's work.  I could feel the temptation, and just angrily ordered the kid to his/her room and went to my room myself.  After praying and asking God's forgiveness, I was much calmer, and did not feel like spanking, but felt that what I had done was enough punishment. -- Doug Fowler: dxf12@po.CWRU.edu  : Me, age 4 & now: ""Mommys and Daddys & other Ever wonder if, after Casey : relatives have to give lots of hugs & love missed the 3rd strike in the poem: & support, 'cause Heaven is just a great he ran to first and made it?     : big hug that lasts forever and ever!!!""

The only record of impact comes from the New Testament. I have no guarantee that its books are in the least accurate, and that the recorded ""impact"" actually happened.  I find it interesting that no other contemporary source records an eclipse, an earthquake, a temple curtain being torn, etc.  The earliest written claim we have of Jesus' resurrection is from the Pauline epistles, none of which were written sooner than 20 years after the supposed event.  (2)  It seems probable that no one displayed the body of Jesus because no one knew where it was.  I personally believe that the most likely explanation was that the body was stolen (by disciples, or by graverobbers). Don't bother with the point about the guards ... it only appears in one gospel, and seems like exactly the sort of thing early Christians might make up in order to counter the grave-robbing charge.  The New Testament does record that Jews believed the body had been stolen.  If there were really guards, they could not have effectively made this claim, as they did.  -Scott O. "

From A Dictionary of Philosophy, by Anthony Flew:  ""Objectivism:  The belief that there are certain moral truths that would remain true whatever anyone or everyone thought or desired.  For instance, 'No one should ever deliberately inflict pain on another simply to take pleasure in his suffering' might be thought of as a plausible example.  Even in a world of sadists who all rejected it, the contention remains true, just as '5 + 7 = 12' remains correct even if there is no one left to count.  The problem for the objectivist is to determine the status of moral truths and the method by which they can be established.  If we accept that such judgements are not reports of what is but only relate to what ought to be (see naturalistic fallacy) then they cannot be proved by any facts about the nature of the world.  Nor can they be analytic, since this would involve lack of action-guiding content;  'One ought always to do the right thing' is plainly true in virtue of the vords involved but it is unhelpful as a practical guide to action (see analytic and synthetic).  At this point the objectivist may talk of 'self-evident truths', but can he deny the subjectivist's claim that self-evidence is in the mind of the beholder?  If not, what is left of the claim that some moral judgements are true?  THe subjectivist may well feel that all that remains is that there are some moral judgements with which he would wish to associate himself.  To hold a moral opinion is, he suggests, not to know something to be true but to have preferences regarding human activity.""  David Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

(Much thanks to Jayne K who is already supporting me with kind words and prayers!)  I've been working at this company for eight years in various engineering jobs.  I'm female.  Yesterday I counted and realized that on seven different occasions I've been sexually harrassed at this company.  Seven times. Eight years. Yesterday was the most recent one; someone left an X-rated photo of a nude woman in my desk drawer.  I'm really upset by this.  I suppose it could have been worse -- it could have been a man having sex with a sheep or something.  There was no note.  I do not know if it was:  - someone's idea of an innocent joke, that went awry - someone's sick idea of flirting - an act of emotional terrorism (that worked!)  I dreaded coming back to work today.  What if my boss comes in to ask me some kind of question, I don't know the answer so I take a military specification down off from my shelf to look up the answer, and out falls a picture of a man having sex with a sheep?  I generally have a Bible on my desk for occasional inspiration; what if I open it up to Corinthians and find a picture a la the North American Man Boy Love Association?  I want to throw up just thinking about this stuff.  I can lock up my desk, but I can't lock up every book I have in the office.  I can't trust that someone won't shove something into my briefcase or my coat pocket when I'm not looking so that I go home to find such a picture, or a threat, or a raunchy note about what someone wants to do to my body.  To make it worse, the entire department went out to lunch yesterday to treat our marvelous secretary to lunch.  The appointed hour for leaving was 11:30.  I was working in another building but wanted to go to the lunch.  So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my number was posted.  So, I came back to a department that looked like a neutron bomb had gone off and I was the sole survivor.  This, despite the fact that everyone knew how bad I felt about this naked woman being left in my desk drawer.  I need some prayers --- I can't stop crying. I am so deeply wounded that it's ridiculous.  I feel like I'm some kind of sub-human piece of garbage for people to reduce me and my sisters to simply sex organs and the sex act.  I feel like I'm a sub-human piece of garbage that's not worthy of a simple phone call saying ""We're leaving for Mary's lunch a little early so that Bob can get back for a big 1:00 meeting...""  Please pray that my resentments will either go away, or be miraculously turned into something positive.  Please pray that whoever is torturing me so will stop, and find some healing for him- or herself. Please pray for my being healed from this latest wound (which falls on top of a whole slew of other wounds...).  Please pray that I can find a new job in a place where the corporate culture does its best to prevent such harrassment from happening in the first place, and swiftly acts appropriately when something occurs despite its best precautions. (This company, in my opinion, has pretty words about how sexual harrassment isn't tolerated but when you get right down to it, how is it that one female engineer can be touched inappropriately, left obsene or threatening notes, left obscene pictures, spoken to lewdly, etc, seven times in eight years in the same place?  Pretty words from the company do me no good when I'm terrified or healing from the latest assault.)  And please pray that I don't turn into an automaton because of this. That's my bad habit: ""ignore it and it will go away"", ""you're not worth anyone's time so don't go talking to anyone about this"", ""you're right, you are a sub-human piece of garbage and deserve to be treated this way"", ""you are just an object"", ""you prostitute your mind to this company so why can't others expect you to prostitute your body there as well?"", ""what makes you think women aren't just possessions, and nothing more than sex organs and their ability to perform the sex act?"" This is the kind of thinking that can catapault one into a major depressive episode; please pray that these thoughts don't come into my head and stay there, triggering depression.  Please pray that this latest trauma doesn't come between me and God. In a way, a wound like this is an invitation to a deeper connection to God, and it's also a possible trigger for a spiritual crisis that can separate one mentally from God.  (I know God doesn't drop me from his loving hand, but it's awfully easy for me to walk to the edge of the hand, look down, think I'm falling and forget that God's still holding on to me.)  Although this probably isn't entirely appropriate for this newsgroup, I really can use the kind of loving support you all provide.

Perhaps they were ""strong in the faith?""  ---------------------------  [No, I don't believe that Paul can overrule God.  However Paul was writing for a largely Gentile audience.  The Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  Thus there is no contradiction with Mat 5. As far as I can tell, both Paul and other Jewish Christians did continue to participate in Jewish worship on the Sabbath.  Thus they continued to obey the Law.  The issue was (and is) with Gentile Christians, who are not covered by the Law (or at least not by the ceremonial aspects of it).  Jesus dealt mostly with Jews.  I think we can reasonably assume that Mat 5 was directed to a Jewish audience.  He did interact with Gentiles a few times (e.g. the centurion whose slave was healed and a couple of others).  The terms used to describe the centurion (see Luke 7) suggest that he was a ""God-fearer"", i.e. a Gentile who followed God, but had not adopted the whole Jewish Law.  He was commended by Jewish elders as a worthy person, and Jesus accepted him as such. This seems to me to indicate that Jesus accepted the prevailing view that Gentiles need not accept the Law.  However there's more involved if you want to compare Jesus and Paul on the Law.  In order to get a full picture of the role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that has been superceded by Christ. Paul's comments are not the world's clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does not entail an abolition of the Law. It still remains as an uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.  For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we live in faith, not Law.  While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the Law.  The ""not an iota or dot"" would suggest a rather literal reading, but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat 5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it. Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the ""ceremonial law"", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite concerned about maintaining moral standards.  The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later to give Paul so much trouble.  It's unfortunate that people use the same terms in different ways, but we should be familiar with that from current conflicts.  Look at the way terms like ""family values"" take on special meaning from the current context.  Imagine some poor historian of the future trying to figure out why ""family values"" should be used as a code word for opposition to homosexuality in one specific period in the U.S.  I think Law had taken on a similar role in the arguments Paul was involved in.  Paul was clearly not rejecting all of the Jewish values that go along with the term ""Law"", any more than people who concerned about the ""family values"" movement are really opposed to family values.  --clh] "

My argument is that the sole purpose of the death penalty is to kill people.  That is it's primary (and I would argue only) purpose.  To continue to kill people by a practice that has almost no utility, especially when you know you will be killing innocents, is unconscionable.  At the very least, the existence of the prison system and our transportation system are based on their merits to society, not their detriments.  We are willing to accept a few lost innocent lives because there is an overwhelming benefit to the continued existence of these systems.  One has to stretch the evidence and the arguments to make the same claim for capital punishment.  Just in case I wasn't clear again:  We maintain a capital punsihment system that kills innocent people and provides us with no net positive gain.  Why?

(818) 354-5011  Contact:  Mary A. Hardin  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993 #1506  Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.  The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took measurements as part of a program established to correlate data with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy (ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle Discovery.  ""We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three important ways,"" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on the balloon research campaign.  ""There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,"" he continued.  ""The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists, and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own right.""  The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps scientists construct more accurate computer models which are instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.  The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere; a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the atmosphere absorbs sunlight.  Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three- hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130 kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m. Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded to separate from the balloon.  ""We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared measurements,"" Margitan explained, ""and we also needed to fly in darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.""  It will be several weeks before scientists will have the completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS scientists.  The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.  The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.

sci.space	" From: dmcaloon@tuba.calpoly.edu (David McAloon) Subject: PLANETS STILL: IMAGES ORBIT BY ETHER TWIST Organization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Lines: 234  ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, ether sucking structures, AND why we observe ""orbital"" motion!!  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago.  I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!   1 I dream like this: ether based reality  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. (non-spinning lattice = ""dark matter"")  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but its ""foot print"" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The ""orbit"" of the earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around by the sun's ether feild.  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and ""distance"" apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because the ""path"" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a ""j"" hook at the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there.  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as ""earth's"" shadow upon it, and at other times totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they look about the same size?  O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S E       /     \ M    |      |      OR                M \ _ _ / S  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating ""turntable view"" of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the day. Try and draw that ""earth shadow."") Its only the moon's image which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.  ""Light-Years"" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. (defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be essentially happening now. The ""piece"" of light may have experienced many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card for Pentium!)  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. [Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I could get with my machine's receiver next to it.  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then die)  Warning about writing to the past: I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by ""advising"" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, existing only on the wind.  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back)  Accepting rides to the past: Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history, none the wiser.  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers.  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets?  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, ""its chaos!"" They said, ""no, its order."" He defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control.  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death) (think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and need a lot less sleep.  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life.  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don't want to be a part of.  I don't claim to be the first to think these things, its just that the others could have been 'pruned' from our path. Maybe these thoughts given to me were laid down on the track of time, after him.    "

Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that).

Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like).  The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was relatively short, so it got cancelled. -- SVR4 resembles a high-speed collision   | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology between SVR3 and SunOS.    - Dick Dunn  |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

Anyway...)  The basis for our (the catholic church's) belief in the assumption of Mary, body and soul, into heaven is that, to put it simply, the apostles and all the early generation Christians believed it.  In fact, throughout their ministry the apostles kept in close contact with Mary, and 11 of the 12 were present when she died.  Only Thomas was missing--when he arrived several days later, he asked to be shown her body, and moved with pity, Peter and several of the other apostles brought him to her tomb.  When they arrived the seal was still unbroken.  They broke the seal, entered, and the body was missing.  There was no sign that anyone had entered, forcibly or otherwise, and everything else was laid out exactly as it had been left.  The apostles present all believed that Mary was assumed into heaven--and the apostles TAUGHT this in their preaching (of course, this does not appear in any of the texts currently considered part of the bible, but it does appear in other writings left behind by several of them.)  Basicaly, as an apostolic church (ie. founded by the apostles), we believe that the teachings of the apostles, whether written down in the bible or written down in other sources, is true, providing that the authenticity of those other sources can be confirmed.  At least in the case of the assumption of Mary, the authenticity is quite clear.  Hope this helps--I would welcome anyone who has more information to add to what I've said. - Mike Walker mdw33310@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu (Univ. of Illinois) ] "

If this is true, how can >this possibly be fair to the infants?  What do you mean fair?  God is just, giving to everyone what they deserve. As all infants are in sin from the time of conception (cf Romans 5.12, Psalm 1.7), they cannot possibly merit heaven, and as purgatory is for the purging of temporal punishment and venial sins, it is impossible that origianl sin can be forgiven.  Hence, the unbaptized infants are cut off from the God against whom they, with the whole of the human race except Mary, have sinned.  Which is why Jesus said, ""Truly, truly I say to you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God unless he is born of water and Spirit"" which is the true meaning of born again (John 3.5).  Thus, as infants are in sin, it is very fair for them to be cut off from God and exlcuded from heaven.

Matthew 25:31-46 is also very clear that those who do not righteous in God's eyes will be sent to hell for eternity. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 states that those who cause trouble for the disciples ""will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord"". 2 Thessalonians 2:9-12 talks about those who refuse to love the truth being condemned. Revelation 21:6-8 talks about the difference between those who overcomes and those who do not.  Those who do not, listed in verse 8, will be in the ""fiery lake of burning sulfur"". Revelation 14:9-12 gives the indication that those who follow the beast ""will be tormented with burning sulfur"" and there being ""no rest day or night"" for them because of it. Psalm 9:17:  ""The wicked return to the grave, all the nations that forget God.""  I think those should be sufficient to prove the point.  >Darius  Joe Fisher  [In the following I'm mostly playing ""devil's advocate"".  I'm not advocating either position.  My concern is that people understand that it's possible to see these passages in different ways.  It's possible to see eternal destruction as just that -- destruction.  Rev often uses the term ""second death"".  The most obvious understanding of that would seem to be final extinction.  The problem is that the NT speaks both of eternal punishment and of second death.  I.e. it uses terms that can be understood either way.  My concern here is not to convince you of one view or the other, but to help people understand that there's a wide enough variety of images that it's possible to understand them either way.  As Tom Albrecht commented, the primary point is to do our best to keep people out of the eternal fire, whatever the details.  (To make things more interesting, Luke 20:35 implies that the damned don't get resurrected at all.  Presumably they just stay dead. -- yes I'm aware that it's possible to understand this passage in a non-literal way.)  2 Peter 2:4-ff is talking about angels, and talks about holding them in hell until the final judgement.  This isn't eternal punishement.  Matthew 25:31-46 talks about sending the cursed into eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.  The fact that the fire is eternal doesn't mean that people will last in its flames forever. Particularly interesting is the comment about the fire having been prepared for the devil and his angels.  Rev 20 and 21 talk about the eternal fire as well.  They say that the beast and the false prophet will be tormented forever in it.  When talking about people being thrown into it (20:13-14), it is referred to as ""the second death"". This sounds more like extinction than eternal torment.  Is is possible that the fire has different effects on supernatural entities such as the devil, and humans?  2 Thessalonians 1:6-10 similarly, what is ""everlasting destruction""? This is not necessarily eternal torment.  This one can clearly be understood either way, but I think it's at least possible to think that everlasting is being used to contrast the kind of destruction that can occur in this life with the final destruction that occurs in eternity.  2 Thessalonians 2:8 again talks about destruction. Revelation 21:6-8: see comment above Revelation 14:9-12 is probably the best of the quotes.  Even there, it doesn't explicitly say that the people suffer forever.  It says that the smoke (and presumably the fire) is eternal, and that there is no respite from it.  But it doesn't say that the people are tormented forever.  Psalm 9:17:  I don't see that it says anything relevant to this issue.  --clh] "

That's possibly a good way to judge the use of the Bible in teaching Jewish morality today, but it hardly seems fair to claim that this highly-interpreted version is what was ""enlightened for its times"". To (attempt to) extend the analogy, this is like saying that the original scissor-makers were unusually advanced at paper-cutting for their times, even though they only ever cut cloth, and had never even heard of paper.  I'm not arguing that the Bible is ""disgusting"", though some of the history depicted in it is, by modern standards.  However, history is full of similar abuses, and I don't think the Biblical accounts are worse than their contemporaries--or possibly ours.  On the other hand, I don't know of any reason to think the history described in the Bible shows *less* abuse than their contemporaries, or ours.  That complex and benign moral traditions have evolved based on particular mythic interpretations of that history is interesting, but I still don't think it fair to take that long tradition of interpretation and use it to attack condemnation of the original history. -- Jim Perry   perry@dsinc.com   Decision Support, Inc., Matthews NC These are my opinions.

Organization: UUNET Technologies Inc, Falls Church, VA, USA Lines: 31 NNTP-Posting-Host: mimi.uu.net   Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft. The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the main spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship.  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton, helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission products).  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they're there.  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?  Thanks.  -- --Jim  --- Jim Goltz                    AlterNet Engineer               goltz@uunet.uu.net "

By not giving up after getting shot himself, Koresh has shown that he too is will to die for what he believes.  As far as healing goes.  If I rememer right the healing that was attributed is not consistent between the different gospels.  In one of them the healing that is done is not any more that faith healers can pull off today.

However, if it can be shown that the set is not all inclusive, then any conclusions bases on the incomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice is one of the original choices.

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  I'm not saying that David Koresh is the Second Coming of Christ.  How could somebody who breaks his word be the Second Coming?  Koresh did promise that he would come out of his compound if only he was allowed to give a radio broadcast.  He didn't.  Still it seems to me that he did fool some people.  And, from my meagre knowledge of the Bible, it seems that Christians have been hard on the Jews of Christ's day for being cautious about accepting somebody that their religious authorities didn't accept as the Messiah.  So I was surprised that nobody had discussed the difficulty of wanting to be early to recognize the Second Coming while, at the same time, not wanting to be credulously believing just anybody who claims to be God.  [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it.

He's telling us not to be misled by the other things that have to happen before his second coming -- the actual second coming will make his power openly visible.

In that posting I made sure I used the word ""public"".  Public revelation contains God's truth intended for everyone to believe.  The revelation contained in the Bible is a significant subset of public revelation.  Private revelation is revelation that God gives to an individual.  He may speak directly to the individual, He may send an angel, or He may send the Virgin Mary or some lesser saint.  The only person who is required to believe a private revelation is the person to whom it is revealed. Devotional practices may be based on reported private revelations, but doctrines can not.  When an alleged private revelation attracts sufficient attention, the Church may investigate it.  If the investigation indicates a likelihood that the alleged private revelation is in fact from God, it will be approved.  That means that it can be preached in the Church.  However, it is still true that no one is required to believe that it came from God.  A Catholic is free to deny the authenticity of even the most well attested and strongly approved private revelations, such as those at Fatima and Lourdes.  (I suspect that few if any Catholics do reject Fatima and Lourdes, but if any do their rejection of them does not mean they are not orthodox Catholics in good standing.)  I do not have at hand a list of the criteria the Church uses in evaluating an alleged private revelation--it's not something I need every day--but I know that one of the primary requirements is that nothing in the alleged private revelation can contradict anything known through public revelation ------- Marty Helgesen Bitnet: mnhcc@cunyvm   Internet: mnhcc@cunyvm.cuny.edu  ""What if there were no such thing as a hypothetical situation?""

The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private. But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff. I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop, and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to start them, etc.  -- Keith Mancus    <mancus@butch.jsc.nasa.gov>                           | N5WVR           <mancus@sweetpea.jsc.nasa.gov>                        | ""Black powder and alcohol, when your states and cities fall,          | when your back's against the wall...."" -Leslie Fish                  | "

sci.space	" From: dbm0000@tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov (David B. Mckissock) Subject: NASA ""Wraps"" News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41 Nntp-Posting-Host: tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov Organization: NASA Lewis Research Center / Cleveland, Ohio Lines: 133  In the April edition of ""One Small Step for a Space Activist"", Allen Sherzer & Tim Kyger write: ""Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes the 'center tax'). When work for a large program like Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10 billion won't be spent on anything having anything to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else.""  My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF to 15,000 science teachers.]  First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax' for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million. This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4 center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at $2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is 04/2.2 = 1.8%  Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30 billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to $540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket change.  I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT* subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the center, and not to the prime contracts.  This leads to the obvious question ""What is the government doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors? (i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten up by the center tax?)""  At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting development funds (as they are supporting the development work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life solar array field (left over from solar cell research research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system.  We have also used the supporting development money to purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone. 38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).  As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations, for performing system analyses (like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system, availability calculations using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements).  Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director does control a small discretionary fund. Each year, any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.  Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general' services at the Center, like the library, the central computer services division, the Contractor who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get an accurate figure, you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library (for example), and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support SSF (which would be hard to compute by itself - how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for 1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week versus the rest of the center personnel). You would then have to compare this estimate of the SSF portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows, maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but we underpay for snow removal? Talk about a burecratic nightmare!  My last point is that I can't believe your claim that Congress has never heard of the term 'center tax.' Unfortunately, all of the NASA testimony before Congress isn't on a computer, so I can't do a simple word search someplace to prove you wrong. But surely, in some GAO audit somewhere, these NASA cost methods were documented for Congress? "

Some say that if the two have : publically announced their plans to marry, have made their vows to God, and : are unswervingly committed to one another (I realize this is a subjective : qualifier) they are married/joined in God's sight.  The way I read Scripture, a couple becomes married when they are *physically* married, i.e. when they first have sexual intercourse.  e.g. the end of Genesis 2 (quoted from memory) ``for this reason, a man shall leave his parents and be joined to his wife, and they will become one flesh'' (Jesus also quotes this scripture referring to marriage).  If you read through Genesis in particular, you will often come across the phraseology: ``[man] lay with [woman], and she became his wife''. This implies that she became his wife when they lay together, i.e. at the point of intercourse.  Compare this with Jewish tradition: Joseph, when he heard that Mary was pregnant, had it in mind to divorce her quietly -- but Mary and Joseph were *betrothed*, not married. i.e., they were in a binding relationship (which required a divorce to get out of), but *marriage* would not occur until Mary and Joseph went to bed together.  Compare with Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5, Revelation 19): the church is described as the ``bride'' of Christ, but the *marriage* of the Lamb takes place when Jesus returns. i.e., we are in a binding love-relationship with Jesus, but we are still looking forward to the time when the marriage will take place. I see this as the spiritual equivalent of sexual intercourse, because it represents the most intimate fellowship possible between man and God.  In summary, engagement should be honoured as a binding relationship, but it is not marriage. A civil ceremony is not marriage either. Marriage occurs at the point when the betrothed couple go to bed together. (I don't mean to demean the civil or church ceremony -- ours was great! I don't mean to be too pedantic.) Historically, I think I am correct in stating that the civil ceremony (i.e. a marriage recognised by the state), has only been around in the West since Napoleon, who introduced it to keep tabs on the people (although I'm ready to be corrected on that point!)  This view obviously raises some questions:  What about those who have had sex with one or more partners, without considering marriage. Are those people also ``married''?  If it is true that marriage occurs at the point of intercourse, is it necessary to be married in the eyes of the state? (I would say Yes, because this honours the laws of our nations in the West. Although it is not illegal to sleep together though unmarried in most Western countries, I believe that it is God- honouring to proclaim our marriage to the state and to our friends before actually consummating our marriage. Its to do with our being salt and light, and also to do with how people will perceive us; i.e. it is culturally insensitive to declare yourself married without going through a civil ceremony.)  --  ----- Michael Davis (cs89mcd@brunel.ac.uk)  And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?

If we unthinkingly adopt pantheistic ideas that are opposed to Christianity, we can pervert our faith.

For the purposes of a contest, you'll probably not compete if'n you can't afford the ride to get there.  And although lower priced delivery systems might be doable, without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a low priced system existed, there might be demand...

In other words, perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology (life support, navigation, etc.) could be developed prior to a low cost launch system. You wouldn't want to use the expensive stuff forever, but I'd hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost Mac, oops, I mean launch system comes on line.

If you think otherwise, try to construct a proof that yesterday happened. Obviously it did; anyone old enough to be reading this was there for it and remembers that it happened. But *proof*? A proof starts with axioms and goes somewhere. You need axioms to talk about logical proof. You can say that you remember yesterday, and that you take as axiom that anything you clearly remember happened. I could counterclaim that you hallucinated the whole thing.  To talk about proofs of historical events, you have to relax the terms a bit. You can show evidences, not proofs. Evidences of the resurrected Jesus exist. Proofs do not.  I think Christianity goes down in flames if the resurrection is ever disproved. I also think that this will not happen, as the evidence for the resurrection is quite good as these things go. It is not entirely fair to claim that you can only take the resurrection on faith. There are reasons to believe it that appeal to the mind, too. "

It seems to me that Hell is eternal death and seperation from God.   But of course, the popular conception of hell (correct or incorrect) is something akin to eternal perpetuation of consciousness, at the very least.   >Most atheists do believe that when they die they will die forever, and never >see God--so they do, in fact, believe that they're going to Hell.  I think a good number of atheists believe there is nothing beyond bodily death, but it is simply an abuse of language to say they believe they're going to hell. They believe they're going to _die_. Understand that you've turned Hell into a verb. Using the same logic, it also follows that all animals are 'going to Hell.' Are you sure this is what you want to say? (presumably animals don't have the opportunity to get to heaven, but this still doesn't change the fact that they're going to Hell (die a final death))  I don't claim to know whether or not there is an afterlife of _some_ sort, but if Hell is as you described (final death, and not eternal perpetuation of consciousness) it will be true that there will never be a moment when I am aware of my non-existence. (assuming I 'go to Hell' and not to Heaven) In other words, I'll never know I'm dead. Hmmm...   >  Hell doesn't have to be worse than earth to be Hell--because it's eternal,  Ever hear people say of a loved one who was ill, and has died: ""At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Heaven now."" ?  Consider the following statement: ""At least she's not suffering any more; She's in Hell now.""  The above statement sounds odd, but according to your definition of Hell, it would be a true statement. The person in Hell would not be suffering. Granted, they wouldn't be *anything* (wouldn't be having any conscious experience whatsoever).  You say Hell (death) is eternal. However, this loses its meaning to a dead person. And to me, it seems that the threat of some sort of eternal punishment only makes sense/has force if one expects to be conscious throughout this eternity.  Many atheists believe that the thirst for an afterlife is simply the product of propaganda (""Friend, do you want the FREE gift of e-ternal life?"" It's my understanding that the early jews did not believe in an afterlife. Can anyone back me up on this?) combined with the survival instinct all animals share. The difference is we have consciousness, and once we get the idea of eternal life drilled into our brains, we then desire a sort of super-survival.   >and it's a lot worse than Heaven.  That's the only comparison that matters.  That would depend on what Heaven is like. If God is a King, and an eternity in heaven consists of giving thanks and praise to the King, I might opt for Hell. I read a lovely account of a missionary trying to convert Eskimos to Christianity in the book _The Illusion of Immortality_ by Corliss Lamont. The missionary started to speak about Heaven. ""Are there seals in heaven? Will we be able to go hunting?"" asked an Eskimo. The missionary said no. The group of Eskimos then said something to the effect of, ""Well what good is your Heaven if there's no hunting? Scram."" I highly recommend the above book (IOI) to anyone who wants an account of the other side of the immortality coin (that there is no immortality).   >Alan Terlep				    ""Incestuous vituperousness"" >Oakland University, Rochester, MI >atterlep@vela.acs.oakland.edu				   --Melissa Eggertsen >Rushing in where angels fear to tread.

Organization: University of Oulu, Finland Lines: 135  Jason Smith (jasons@atlastele.com) wrote:  : [ The discussion begins: why does the universe exist at all?  ]  : One of the Laws of Nature, specifying cause and effect seems to dictate : (at least to this layman's mind) there must be a causal event.  No : reasonable alternative exists.  I would argue that causality is actually a property of spacetime; causes precede their effects. But if you claim that there must be an answer to ""how"" did the universe (our spacetime)  emerge from ""nothing"", science has some good candidates for an answer.  I have always wondered why Christians use the ""There are questions science (or atheism) cannot answer"" argument; I hope this is the appropriate group to ask this question.  The most popular question is the question of origins. Why does the universe exist, or anything, for that matter?  I think this question should actually be split into two parts, namely  1) Why is there existence? Why anything exists?  and  2) How did the universe emerge from nothing?  It is clear science has nothing to say about the first question. However, is it a meaningful question, after all?  I would say it isn't. Consider the following:  A die-hard skeptic being (be it human or whatever) attempts to doubt one's very existence. Since it is so easy to doubt everything else - I cannot be _sure_ the world exists, it may be my mind fooling me - can I ever be sure I exist?  However, it is only possible to exist or not to exist. (Someone insert an appropriate Shakespeare quote here ;-) )  A being that does not exist cannot doubt one's existence. A being that does exist can doubt one's existence, but this would be pointless - the being would exist anyway.  Let us return to the original question: why? A being that does not exist does not need any reasons for its non-existence. This being is not _sure_ whether anything else exists but his mind, but let us assume that the world exists independent of the mind (the objectivity postulate). The question ""why anything exists"" can be countered by demanding answer to a question ""why there is nothing in nothingness, or in non-existence"". Actually, both questions turn out to be devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist don't exist. Tautology at its best.  I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence. This argument sounds like God does not exist, but meta-exists, and from His meta-existent perspective, He created existence. I think this is actually a nonsolution, a mere twist of words.  The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  The second question: How did the universe emerge from nothing? belongs to the domain of science, and I, for one, do not doubt the question can be answered by its methods. Many cosmologists have suggested that it is entirely possible for universes to emerge from vacuum (this possibility has been suggested in a recent Hawking biography; see also Lizhi & Shuxian: Creation of the Universe, World Scientific, 1989). However, I think the sci groups are more appropriate for discussions like this.  : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a ""why"".  That isn't : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural).  This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us ""how"", not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the ""why"" questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the supernatural domain exists. If supernatural beings exist, it is as appropriate to ask why they do so as it is to ask why we exist.  : I believe the ""genetic code"" will be entirely deciphered in our lifetimes, : but we will not see man convert entirely inert material into self sustaining, : reproducing life, *ever*.

I don't believe *any* : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite : having all of the parts available. Just my opinion.  This opinion is also called vitalism; namely, that living systems are somehow _fundamentally_ different from inanimate systems. Do Christians in general adopt this position? What would happen when scientists announce they have created primitive life (say, small bacteria) in a lab?  There is a problem with your prophecy: artificial life has been created, although not yet in a chemical form. Computer simulations of evolution contain systems that are as much alive as any bacterium, although their code is electronic, as well as their metabolism. See a recent book  Steven Levy: Artificial life - The Quest for a New Creation. Jonathan Cape, London 1992.  Artificial chemical life is just around the corner - after all, no spark of life has been found to be necessary; living systems do not violate any physical laws as we know them.  : You don't mind if a few of us send up a prayer on your behalf during your : research, do you?

Society accepts the risk that an innocent person will be murdered by execution.  And, every member of society shares this blame.  And, most people's definitions of murder include some sort of malicious intent, which is not involved in an execution, is it?  >>But, we were trying to discuss an objective moral system, or at least its >>possibilty.

Reading the minds of the jury would certainly tell whether or not a conviction was moral or not.

Yes, while we could objectively determine the difference (if we knew all possible information), we can't always determine the difference in our flawed system.  I think that our system is almost as good as possible, but it still isn't objectively perfect.  You see, it doesn't matter if we *know* it is fair or not.

One reply, which I have lost, suggested several parishes in New York that have good Masses, one of which was Corpus Christi in downtown Manhattan.  By coincidence, last week's _America_, the national Jesuit magazine, carried an interview with Fr. Myles Bourke, Corpus Christi's pastor emeritus.  Fr. Bourke also directed the NT translation in the New American Bible.  He noted ""...certain practices have been introduced into the Mass in such a manner that an atmosphere of banality, and sometimes of hilarity, has trivialized the liturgy.""  I note that at my parents' parish on Easter, helium filled balloons were distributed at the offertory, apparently to aid in understanding the word ""risen"".  This was not a kiddie mass, either, but the well-attended 11:00 Mass.  I wanted to note the generous spirit behind the replies.  This newsgroup as a whole offers generally moderate (perhaps because it's moderated) conversation on topics that often lead people to extreme behavior (including myself). Sometimes people do go over the top, but the remarkable thing is how that is the exception, I think.  Benefits of the doubt are generally granted.  It seems so...Christian?  John Murray "

They could have beaten us if either:  * Their rocket hadn't blown up on the pad thus setting them back,  and/or  * A Saturn V went boom.  If they had beaten us, I speculate that the US would have gone head and done some landings, but we also would have been more determined to set up a base (both in Earth Orbit and on the Moon).  Whether or not we would be on Mars by now would depend upon whether the Soviets tried to go.  Setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and I think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to Mars (at least in the short run).

soc.religion.christian	" From: halsall@murray.fordham.edu (Paul Halsall) Subject: Weirdness of Early Christians Reply-To: halsall@murray.fordham.edu Organization: J. Random Misconfigured Site Lines: 76   I am a good Catholic boy. A convert no less, attracted by the rational tradition [Aquinas et al] and the emotional authenticity [in comp. with the faddishness of Anglicanism] to Roman Catholicism. I never had much time for the pope - or any other heirarchs - but I did, and do, believe in the sacremental system. I always felt quite happy to look down my nose at those such as John Emery [a few posts back] who had to engage in circuitous textual arguments to prove their faith, entirely oblivious to the fact that a dozen other faiths can do the same [with miracles too], and that since their arguments depend on the belief in the Bible as God's sole revelation, it was not very good logic to argue that the Bible proved God. No, I was happy to accept the CHURCH as God's revelation. It was the Church after all that existed before the Bible, the Church that choose [under grace of course] the canon of scripture. Protestant ludicrosity, I thought, was shown by Protestants breathtaking acceptance of Luther's right to reject a dozen or so books he disliked. But recently I read Peter Brown's _Body and Society_. It is very well researched, and well written. But is raises some very upsetting questions. The early Christians were weird - even more so than today's carzy fundies. They had odd views on sex, odder views on the body, totally ludicrous views about demons, and distinctly uncharitable views about other human beings. now the question is this: were the first Christians just as weird, but we've got used to them, or did the pristine ""Fall of the Church"" happen within one generation. It certainly did'nt have to wait until the Triumph of the Church under Constantine. If so, wha does  this say about God's promise to always support the Church. It's no use throwing the usual Protestant pieties about the Church not being an organization at me. It's a community or it is nothing, and it was the early communities that were weird. The institional church was a model of sanity by comparison. I would be interested in serious Catholic and Orthodox responses to this entirely serious issue. I'm not sure it is an issue for Protestants with their ""soul alone with Jesus"" approach, but for we who see the ""ecclesia"" as a ""koinoia"" over time and space, the weird early Christians are a problem.  [This is an exaggeration of the Protestant view.  Many Protestants have a strong appreciation for the role of the Church.  ""The soul alone with God"" is certainly important for Protestants, but it's by no means the whole story.  I have read the sort of history you talk about.  As you point out, Protestants don't have quite the same problem you do, because we believe that the church had a Fall at some point.  However Protestant mythology typically places the Fall around the time of Constantine (or more likely, regard it as happening in a sort of cumulative fashion, starting from Constantine but getting worse as the Pope accumulated power during the medieval period.)  The consequences of having it earlier are somewhat worrisome even to us.  Most Protestants accept the theological results of the early ecumenical councils, including such items as the Trinity and Incarnation.  Indeed in the works of Reformers such as Luther and Calvin, you'll find Church Fathers such as Augustine quoted all the time.  I think you'll find many Protestants resistant to the idea that the Early Church as a whole was ""wierd"".  (There is an additional problem for Protestants that I don't much want to talk about in this context, since it's been looked at recently -- that's the question of whether one can really think of Augustine and other Fathers as being proto-Protestants.  Their views on Mary, the authority of the Pope, etc, are not entirely congenial to Protestant thought.)  One thing that somewhat worries me is a question of methodology. There are certainly plenty of wierd people in the early church.  What concerns me is that they may be overrepresented in what we see.  We see every Christian who courted martyrdom.  But I think there's good reason to believe that most ordinary Christians were more prudent than that.  We see the heroic virgins.  But I think there's good reason to think that many Christians were happily married.  I can't help suspecting that the early church had the same range of wierdos and sane people that we do now.  I think there's also a certain level of ""revisionism"" active in history at the moment.  I don't mean that they're manufacturing things out of whole cloth.  But don't you think there might be a tendency to emphasize the novel?  --clh] "

soc.religion.christian	 From: jodfishe@silver.ucs.indiana.edu (joseph dale fisher) Subject: Re: prayers and advice requested on family problem Organization: Indiana University Lines: 34  Julie, it is a really trying situation that you have described.  My brother was living with someone like that and things were almost as bad (although he left after a considerably shorter amount of time due to other problems with the relationship).  Anyway, the best thing to do would be to get everyone in the same room together (optimally in a room with nothing breakable), lock the door behind you, throw the key out underneath the door (just as far as the longest hand can reach.  You would like to get out after the conclusion, I would imagine), and hash things out.  More than likely, there will be screaming, crying, and possibly hitting (unless of course someone decided to bring some rope to tie people down).  Some of the best strategies in keeping things calmer would include: have each individual own their own statements (ie, I feel that this relationship is hurting everyone involved because.... or I really don't understand where you're coming from.) reinforce statements by paraphrasing, etc. (ie, So you think that we did this because of...?  Well, let me just say that the reason for this was ....) don't accuse each other (It was your fault that ... happened!) find a common ground about SOMETHING (Lampshades really are decorational and functional at the same time.) Guaranteed, in a situation like this, there is going to be some gunnysacking (re-hashing topics which were assumed resolved, but were truly not and someone feels someone else is to blame).  However, this should be kept to a minimum and simply ask for forgiveness or apologize about each situation WITHOUT holding a smoldering grudge.  The relationship really can work.  It's just a matter of keeping things smooth and even.  It's sort of like making a peace treaty between warring factions:  you can't give one side everything; there must be a compromise.  Breaks can be taken, but communication between everyone involved must continue if the relationships here are to survive.  Joe Fisher

Firstly, what do you exactly mean by ""fundamentalist""?  I will for the time being assume that what you mean is that your friend believes that the bible is God's word to mankind?  I suspect that what happened to him is what he'll call being ""born again""?  Anyway, was that recent? If the answer is ""yes"" to all the questions above, it is quite understandable.  However, IMO, I'ld rather give advice to your friend! I think I've been through something similar to him, and one thing I can say is that the basic problem is that each of you are now trying to communicate from different worldviews.  Why he talks about those things is because they are now ""obvious"" to him.  What is ""obvious"" to him is not obvious to you.  Secondly, why he may be very persuasive is because from his point of view, he has been on ""both sides of the fence"".  This I mean that before he turned ""fundamentalist"", you two are agreeable because both of you see things from the same side.  If suddenly, as if a new world of reality has suddenly opened up to him, it is like the discovery of let's say a new continent, or a new planet.  To him, he's got to tell you because he has seen something much more wonderful than where he was, and what he thinks is much better than where you are now. You have got to realise that from his point of view, he means well to you, eventhough he may end up offending you.  To him, it is worth that risk.  Nevertheless, it is really up to him to respect where you stand and listen to you as well.  At this moment, it may be difficult because he is either very excited or feel it is too urgent to keep quiet about, however, he may not realise that he's really putting you off.

How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he >won't try?  Thanks for any advice.  So far, I've only been trying to explain things from his side.  However, I do understand how you feel too, because I wasn't a Christian for a good part of my life as well.  I was quite turned off by Christians or ""fundamentalists"" who were really all out and enthusiastic about their faith.  They really scared me, to tell you the truth.  Unfortunately, ""religious belief"" is a very personal thing, just as your agnosticism is also a very personal thing to you.  Since the Christian belief is inevitably at odds with anything non-Christian (religious or otherwise), it will be a touchy matter.  Like all friendships, it will take both sides to do their part to make it work.  In this matter, maybe you can do your part by telling him nicely that you are not able to dig what he's trying to convince you about, that it's beyond you or not your concern ""for now"".  Don't tell him it's nonsense, because to him it is reality - and that would be a real insult.  He'll also have to be careful not to insult where you stand too.  Like I said before, I wish I could give your friend some advice too. I'll admit that I did similarly to some of my friends when I became a Christian.  In some ways, I wish I could have done things a little differently.  However, it was difficult then because I was so excited and just blabbered away about what I've found!  To me, it was too good not to know.  To some, I was crazy, and I didn't really care most of the time what they thought.  You will probably think he's crazy too - but God is very real to him, as real as you are to him.  Keep that in mind.  And he thinks he can convince you because since God is so real to him, he doesn't see why God can't be real to you too.  I don't know how helpful this is to you.  But all the best anyhow - this is quite a challenge for you to face.  By the way, personal conviction: nobody is ""beyond saving"" except the one we call the devil and his hosts.

So your are saying to rely on our feelings and experiences (since this is the only other source of information left to us). How can you then convince somebody that your ""feelings and experiences"" are the correct ones then if you can't show somebody visible and measurable effects?  If my experiences say that ""there exists no god"" and yours says there does, where does that leave us?  Since we are only going on experiences, then both of us are correct within our own personal realities.  Furthermore, the trouble with ""feelings and experiences"" is that they can lead you astray, as the tragic outcome of Waco illustrates.  I am sure that many of Koresh's followers really believed in him but I think that you and I will agree that they were being misled.

You must be using a definition of ""evidence"" that I am not familiar with. To me, evidence is something you can show others -unambiguously- that what you are saying is true.  However, I agree with you that belief in a diety is a matter of faith. It is not something you can share around - others must experience it independantly.  Unfortunately, as I have explained above, this puts belief down to a matter of experience.  My impression is that Christians do not have the monopoly on reason, evidence and faith as far as any of these things can go.  > In a previous article, phs431d@vaxc.cc.monash.edu.au () says: > >>You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.

At the risk of repeating my argument : As I have explained previously, the trouble is that Moslems, Buddhists, Jews, etc will ALL say that THEY claim, with good reason, to be a valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations to man (for Buddhists it should read ""for explaining the non-existence of God"").  So not only must you ""prove"" your own case, you have to ""disprove"" theirs.

LOGICAL PROOFS OF JESUS CHRIST'S RESURRECTION  1.  Jesus's enemies *would not* have stolen His body because that would have perpetrated the resurrection--the very opposite of what they desired.  2.  Jesus' disciples *could not* have stolen His body because Pontius Pilate established guards to stand watch over the tomb lest His body be stolen.  3.  Sadly (and ironically), many of Jesus' disciples did not believe in the Resurrection until Jesus had risen from the dead.  4.

The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.  Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.   VIEWING IMAGES  The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X, use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP sites.  The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.   ONLINE ARCHIVES  NASA AMES  Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.  FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the archive (the index is about 200K by itself).  To access the archives by email, send a letter to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:  send SPACE Index send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.  The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this section for images or programs.  The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are available in these collections.  The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).  The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.  Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).   NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM  The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140 data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition, ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors, keywords, title words, or abstract text words.  ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu.

NASA SPACELINK  SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop between the user and NASA.  SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.  You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8 bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.  Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in directory SPACELINK.   NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)  The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.

Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billion for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done than because they expect to make money off the deal. -- Josh Hopkins                                          jbh55289@uxa.cso.uiuc.edu ""Find a way or make one."" -attributed to Hannibal "

You have made what I consider factual misstatements about events in the book, which I have raised in the past, in the ""ISLAM: a clearer view"" thread as well as the root of the ""Yet more Rushdie [Re: ISLAMIC LAW]"" thread.  My statement was not that you had not read the book, but that you had not convinced me that you [inter alia] had.  As I said before, if you want to defend your position, then produce evidence, and respond to the evidence I have posted; so far you have not.  Of course, my statement was not directly aimed at you, but broadly at a number of Muslim posters who have repeated propaganda about the book, indicating that they haven't read it, and narrowly at Gregg Jaeger, who subsequently admitted that he hadn't in fact read the book, vindicating my skepticism in at least that one case.  So far, the only things I have to go on regarding your own case are a) the statements you made concerning the book in the ""a clearer view"" posting, which I have challenged (not interpretation, but statements of fact, for instance ""Rushdie depicts the women of the most respected family in all of Islam as whores""), and b) your claim (which I had not seen before this) that you have indeed read it cover to cover.  I am willing to try to resolve this down to a disagreement on critical interpretation, but you'll have to support your end, by responding to my criticism.  I have no doubt as to the ability of a particular Muslim to go through this book with a highlighter finding passages to take personal offense at, but you have upheld the view that ""TSV *is* intended as an attack on Islam and upon Muslims"".  This view must be defended by more than mere assertion, if you want anyone to take it seriously.  >I am trying very hard to be amicable and rational.  And I appreciate it, but welcome to the club.  I am defending my honest opinion that this book should not be construed as a calculated (or otherwise) insulting attack on Islam, and the parallel opinion that most of the criticism of the book I have seen is baseless propaganda.

soc.religion.christian	 From: JBUDDENBERG@vax.cns.muskingum.edu (Jimmy Buddenberg) Subject: Revelations - BABYLON? Organization: Muskingum College Lines: 34   Hello all.  We are doing a bible study (at my college) on Revelations.  We have been doing pretty good as far as getting some sort of reasonable interpretation.  We are now on chapters 17 and 18 which talk about the woman on the beast and the fall of Babylon.  I believe the beast is the Antichrist (some may differ but it seems obvious) and the woman represents Babylon which stands for Rome or the Roman Catholic Church.  What are some views on this interpretation?  Is the falling Babylon in chapter 18 the same Babylon in as in chapter 17?  The Catholic church? Hate to step on toes. thanks  -------- Jimmy Buddenberg       INTERNET:  jbuddenberg@vax.cns.muskingum.edu Muskingum College  [Reading this imagery as the Roman Catholic Church was certainly common in earlier Protestant writers.  A lot of us find that frankly embarassing now, though some of our readers will certainly advocate such a position.  The problem is that the description makes it look a lot like a political entity.  It's associated with kings, controls world commerce, is seated on seven mountains (17:9 -- recall that Rome is traditionally regarded as built on seven hills).  If it's a church, then it's not the current Roman Catholic church, but a church that has been taken over by the anti-Christ and merged with the state, turning into something rather different than it is now.  Presumably in such a scenario the true Catholics are among those who are persecuted.  Given the overall impression that Satan is pretending to be an angel of light, and the true church is a persecuted remnant, I think the most consistent playing out of the image would be that the anti-Christ would be presiding over a church that claims to be the heir of both the Protestant and Catholic traditions, but that the true spiritual descendants of both Peter and the Reformers are equally being persecuted.  --clh]

Yes, sin can have terrible consequences, but we need to be *real* careful when saying that the consequences are a *punishment* for sin.  The Jews of Jesus's time believed that all sickness was the result of a sin.  Then Jesus healed a blind man and said that man was blind to show the glory of God, not because of sin.  If AIDS, or any other STD is a *punishment"" for sexual sin, what do we do with diseases like cancer, or multiple sclerosis, which are just as debilitating and terrible as AIDS, yet are not usually linked to a specific behavior or lifestyle? > >In addition, IMHO forgiveness is not the end of things. >There is still the matter of atonement. Is it AIDS ? >I don't know.  Atonement is *extremely* important, but I think you've missed the mark about as far as you can by suggesting that AIDS is an atonement for sin. The atonement for sin is JESUS CHRIST - period.  This is the central message of the Gospel.  A perfect sacrifice was required for our sins, and was made in the Lamb of God.  His sacrifice atoned for *all* of our sins, past present and future.  God does not require pennance for our sins, nor does he require us to come up with our own atonement.  He has graciously already done that for us.  To suggest that AIDS or some other consequence is an atonement for sins is literally spitting on the sacrifice that Jesus made.  In case you couldn't tell, I get *extremely* angry and upset when I see things like this.  Instead of rationalizing our own fears and phobias, we need to be reaching out to people with AIDS and other socially unacceptable diseases.  Whether they got the disease through their own actions or not is irrelevant.  They still need Jesus Christ, no more and no less than we do.  I've said this before, but I think it's a good analogy.  People with AIDS are modern-day lepers.  Jesus healed many lepers.  He can also heal people with AIDS, maybe not on this earth, but in an ultimate sense.  My next-door neighbor has AIDS. She has recently come to have a much deeper and more committed relationship with God.  Her theology isn't what I would want it to be, but God's grace covers her.  The amazing thing is that she is gaining weight (she's had the disease for over 2 years) and her health is excellent apart from occassional skin rashes and such.  She attributes her improvement in her health to God's intervention in her life.  Who are we to suggest that her disease is some kind of punishment?  It seems to me that God is being glorified through her disease.

This is one of my favorite fallacious points against atheism, i.e. the belief that you can't deny anything that you can't prove doesn't exist. This is easily nailed by showing that an infinite number of beings are conceivable but not observed to exist, does this mean that we would have to believe in all of them?  According to the above poster, we must believe in objects or beings that haven't been proved not to exist so why stop at God?   (there could be a huge number of beings identical to Ronald Reagan except for trivial differences, say one is missing a finger, one has blond hair,... and they all live  on other planets so we can't see them)  The reason no one but atheists bring this up is that none of these christians have a vested interest in these unknown beings with the exception of God.  >Fine, but why do these people shoot themselves in the foot and mock the idea of >a God?

There is a big difference here, Stalin didn't say that he stood for a particular moral position (i.e. against murder and terrorism, etc.) and then did the opposite (like the religious movements), he was at least an honest killer.  (This is NOT a support of Stalin but an attack on this viewpoint).  Saying that atheism supports murder and violence just because one man was a tyrant and an atheist is just bad logic, look at all the russians that helped Stalin that weren't atheists - don't they contradict your point?  Besides your point assumes that his atheism was relevant to his murdering people, this is just the common assumption that atheists can't value life as much as theists (which you didn't support).  >	Agnostics are not as funny because they are more reasonable.  Yet >they do in some sense seem funny because they believe that the existence of God >is unknowable.  This in itself is every bit the assumption that atheism is, >though it's less arrogant and pompous.  Ah, and here's another point you didn't get out of the FAQ.  An atheist doesn't have to hold the positive view that god doesn't exist, he/she may just have the non-existence of the positive belief.  Here's the example:  Strong atheism - ""I believe god does not exist""   a positive belief  Weak atheism   - ""I don't believe in a god""       a negative belief  these are NOT the same, some one that has never thought of the idea of god in their whole life is technically an atheist, but not the kind that you are calling unreasonable.  Or let's look at it this way (in sets)  suppose that a given person has a huge set of ideas that I will represent as capital letters and these people then either believe that these ideas exist as real objects or not.  So if S = santa, then E(S)= no is the person not believing in santa but still having the idea of santa.  But notice that even E(S) = no  is itself another idea!  This means you have lots of cases:  christian :  (A,E(A)=yes,B,E(B)=no,  . . . G,E(G)=yes......) where G = god  atheist (strong) : (A,E(A). . . . .G,E(G)=no)  atheist (weak) : (A,.....E)     i.e. no G at all in the set  agnostic :  (A,.......G, E(G) = indeterminate, E', ....)   >	Why are people so afraid to say ""undecided""?

This >also means that Christ had all of the legal rights of a decendant of >David as according to at least Roman law (and possibly Mosaic law as >well, but I am not sure) Joseph was Christ's LEGAL FATHER.  The argument for Luke's genealogy being that of Mary is very weak. According to Luke 3:23  And when he began his ministry, Jesus himself was about thirty years of age, being supposedly the son of Joseph, the son of Eli,  Aside from the fact that Mary is not mentioned, there are two possible interpretations: either Joseph was her father or he was her brother. Clearly this is not acceptable.  A third would be that Joseph, the son of Eli, was her Father and just happened to have the name as the man to whom she was betrothed. But that would seem to be grasping at straws. The most straightforward interpretation is that Luke had no intention of tracing Mary's genealogy (in which case he would have named her) but that he traces her husband's, from David's son Nathan.  The Matthew descendant list most definitely traces down from David's son, Solomon, to Joseph.  Matthew 1:16 reads:  And to Jacob was born Joseph, the husband of Mary, by whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.  There are two apparent problems.  The first is, how to reconcile the two paternal genealogies - which diverge with the sons of David, Solomon and Nathan.  The second is, why is any genealogy of Joseph relavent at all, if Joseph had nothing to do with it.  If Joseph was not Jesus's physical father, then the original poster is quite correct, that claims for Jesus's messianic heritage are not based on truth but only on appearances, whatever Jesus's divine nature was.  The second problem is easy, in my mind.  We assume that Joseph was not involved in the conception of Jesus in any way.  However, a Holy Spirit capable of working a physical conception in Mary is also capable of employing the physical agency of Joseph's seed in this work.  In our materialistic times we interpret viginity and its loss solely in terms of a physical act, whereas it is really a matter of purity on a much higher level as well.  The important thing is that neither Mary nor Joseph was conscious of any union between them (they had not ""known""each other).  Thus the first gospel's dedication of half its opening chapter to the genealogy of Joseph is quite relevant to Jesus, the Virgin birth not- withstanding.  To the first question there is an answer that creates, to begin with, more problems than it resolves.  It is that the two evangelists are relating the births of two entirely different children of two entirely different sets of parents.  Except for the names of the parents and the child, and the birthplace in Bethlehem there is no point in common between the two stories.  Matthew and Luke converge in their accounts only thirty years later with the Baptism of Jesus in Jordan.  Rudolf Steiner offered his explanation of how these accounts begin with two children and then converge with their accounts of the one Jesus of Nazareth.  He did not derive his resolution from biblical study or speculation, or from other external documents, and the discussion of ""how this could be"" might bring us beyond the limits of appropriateness for this newsgroup.  In any case, the details are described in Steiner's ""The Spiritual Guidance of the Human Being and of Humanity"", ""The Gospel of St. Luke"", and ""The Gospel of St. Matthew"".  Whether or not Rudolf Steiner's methods and explanation are accepted as valid, at least this interpretation resolves the apparent contradictions of the two genealogies while leaving the text intact.  As for the passing of one's Jewishness through the mother, this was never an issue with Jesus. No one ever questioned his or Mary's Jewishness.  The issue of the genealogies has to do with his paternal line of descent from David, the king.  Gerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com) "

And recently, the pastor of my church drew an analogy, which I also found useful--A woman is often percieved by others in three ways, depending on their relationship to her--a mother, a wife and an employee in a business.

How can we as mortals locked into space-time conceive of it? 2a. If the best we can do is metaphor/analogy, then what is the best metaphor?  C S Lewis's essay THE WEIGHT OF GLORY deals with this question. I recommend it enthusiastically. You might also read the chapter on ""Heaven"" in his book THE PROBLEM OF PAIN. He gives a fictional treatment in his book THE GREAT DIVORCE. I have found all of these very helpful.  You might also be helped by the treatment in Dante's DIVINE COMEDY. Heaven occupies the last third of the poem, but I cannot imagine reading it other than from the beginning. I urge you to use the translation by Dorothy L Sayers, available from Penguin Paperbacks.

The style and language together with the theology are usually used as counterargument.  The argument that John was a disciple relies on the claim in the gospel of John itself. Is there any other evidence for it?  One step and one generation removed is bad even in our times. Compare that to reports of similar events in our century in almost illiterate societies.

As a former Catholic and now as a very active Lutheran - it is some of the ""innovations"" of the Mass which made me leave the Catholic Church and return to the more traditional Catholic Chuch - the Lutherans.  I spent many years as a Lector reading the Passion parts as appropriate in the Catholic Church and I found it very meaningful.  Our Lutheran parish just instituted the ""Tenebrae"" service for Good Friday and I was the lector for a paraphrased Passion which was exceptional.  I heard and learned things that I have previously overlooked in the Gospels - yet those ""facts"" were always there.  As a matter of interest, the pastor and I were talking about the differences between the RC and Lutheran Church during Holy Week over breakfast Easter Sunday. > >   As a member of a liturgy committee, I can tell you that the problem >is certain people dominating, who want to try out all kinds of >innovations.  The priests don't seem even to _want_ to make any >decisions of their own in many cases.  I guess it's easier to ""try >something new"" than it is to refuse to allow it.  My wife is the member of the liturgy committee in the family (called music and worship at our church).  Our pastor does have control of this committee but listens very carefully to the committee's suggestions.  It needs a strong hand to lead and guide, to keep the intent and the message clear and strong as it should be through Lent and the rest of the liturgical year.  Additional reason for my leaving the Catholic faith - lack of any selfless spiritual guidance by priests in my parishes.  AKA ""wishy-washy"".  As you may gather from my comments, I feel that it is very important, ir- regardless of denominational guidelines, to have a service/Mass which promotes the true reason that we are gathered there.  I am quite comfortable in a traditional Mass, with receiving Holy Communion on the tongue, the Sacrament of PENANCE (not Reconciliation), Stations of the Cross, so on and so forth. The reason other types of Masses and parishes exist is because these feelings are not shared by everyone.  I want more people to attend church and to find the Lord, but I don't want them attending a show.  It's not.  My church works hard to have a meaningful service during Lent on Wednesdays, but follow traditional Lutheran Book of Worship guidelines.  Where things are changed or omitted during Lent (such as the Hymn of Praise) it is noted so that we are aware of the reasons that it is Not there.  Quite frankly, it is very hard for a non-Catholic to go to a Mass and ""fit in"". My dear wife never could (former Methodist).  And Holy Week Masses and Vigils would intimidate the daylights out of a non-Catholic.  Those Catholics who have beared with me this far understand what I mean.  Please keep in mind why we are there - to gather together in worship.  Not to worry about how something is done or not done.  If there is something wrong that you feel needs addressing, by all means talk to your priest or pastor.  I have only ever met one who wouldn't listen.  They are there to provide spiritual guidance and to help.  Use them.  My differences with the Catholic Church are much more fundamental - but my decision to change faiths was done with prayer, intervention, and sessions with priests and ministers.

These projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the constellation.  Firstly, different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function: thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits, comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation, providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.  SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization.  [1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now: COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET. We might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.  [2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity, but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation, and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars, Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown, follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface, testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions are spent on astronauts.  [3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs, inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.  By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag, we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose orbits.  N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality. Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology greenhouses on Mars at low cost.   -- Nick Szabo					 szabo@techboook.com "

Well, for example, the goal of ""natural"" morality is the survival and propogation of the species.  Another example of a moral system is presented within the Declaration of Independence, which states that we should be guaranteed life liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  You see, to have a moral system, we must define the purpose of the system.  That is, we shall be moral unto what end?  >>Murder is certainly a violation of the golden rule.

Well, murder violates the golen rule, which is certainly a pillar of most every moral system.  However, I am not assuming that our current system and the manner of its implementation are objectively moral.

soc.religion.christian	" From: dwatson@cser.encore.com (Drew Watson) Subject: Ethics vs. Freedom Organization: Encore Computer Corporation Lines: 70  Being a parent in need of some help, I ask that you bear with me while I describe the situation which plagues me...  I am a divorced father. Chance would have it that ""my weekend"" with my daughter has fallen upon Easter Weekend this year.  Although I am Presbyterian, I had married a Catholic woman. We decided that the Catholic moray of indoctrination of the spouse into the faith was too confining (and restrictive due to time as we had already set a date), and we were married in a Christian Church which was non-denominational.  During the years of our marriage, we did not often attend church.  When our daughter was born, some years later, my wife insisted that she be baptised as Catholic. This wasn't a problem with me.  During a separation of five years, my ex-wife was taken ill with a disease that affected her mental capacities. She was confined to a mental ward for two months before it was diagnosed. It has since been treated ""effectively"".  In other words, professionals have deemed her a functioning member of society.  During the recuperation, my ex-wife has embraced Buddism. Her influence over my daughter has been substantial, and has primarily allowed me only Saturday visitation for a number of years. During this period I have read Bible study books to my daughter, and tried to keep her aware of her Christian heritage.  Last fall, our divorce was finalized after a year of viscious divorce hearings. At that time I was awarded visitation rights every other weekend. At that time, I started taking my daughter to church quite often, although not every weekend. I did this to attempt to strengthen the Christian ethic and expose her to a religious community.  Today, Easter Sunday, I took my daughter to church. When it came time for Communion, my daughter took the bread (The body of Christ) but left the wine (The blood of Christ) professing that she was too young for wine. She then balled the bread up in her hand and tried to descretely throw it under the pew in front of us.  I feel this was a slap in the face to me, my religion, and an afront to her religious heritage. It can be construed as breaking several of the commandments if you try. I really felt dishonored by the action.  My daughter is only nine years old, but I think she should have been old and mature enough to realize her actions. I have difficulty blaming her directly for religious teachings her mother swears to, but when I discussed this with my daughter she made it clear she believed in Buddhism and not Christianity.  My initial response of anger (moderated) was to suggest if there is no faith in Christ then why does she celebrate Easter, or Christmas? I suggested I would never force her to practice my religious beliefs by celebrating holidays with her again.  I do not want to ""drive her from the fold"", and would be willing to allow her to continue practicing Buddhism (as though I had a choice seeing her only for two days out of fourteen) but I want her to want to embrace Christianity.  Any suggestions?  If you have a response, please e-mail me a copy. (I'm not a regular reader of this newsgroup.) (Naturally, feel free to post too!)  Thanks, and I hope you've had a happy Easter.

sci.space	" From: lochem@fys.ruu.nl (Gert-Jan van Lochem) Subject: Dutch: symposium compacte objecten Summary: U wordt uitgenodigd voor het symposium compacte objecten 26-4-93 Keywords: compacte objecten, symposium Organization: Physics Department, University of Utrecht, The Netherlands Lines: 122  Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten' op 26 april 1993   In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350 jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.  De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht, vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er staat echter meer op stapel.  Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten 'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren. Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren, waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op een apart vel. Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!  Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar, in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren. Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en trachten te verklaren. Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10 miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30 Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.  Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening 44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na 31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.  Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I, Universiteit Utrecht.

Whether there is a ""why"" or not we have to find it. This is Pascal's(?) wager. If there is no why and we spend our lives searching, then we have merely wasted our lives, which were meaningless anyway. If there is a why and we don't search for it, then we have wasted our potentially meaningful lives. Suppose the universe is 5 billion years old, and suppose it lasts another 5 billion years. Suppose I live to be 100. That is nothing, that is so small that it is scary. So by searching for the ""why"" along with my friends here on earth if nothing else we aren't so scared.  What if you woke up at a party, with no memory, and everyone was discussing who the host might be? There might not be a host, you say. I say let's go find him, the party's going to be over sometime, maybe he'll let us stay.  Because we recognize our own mortality we have to find the ""why"".  > ... > Well, then, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Hinduism, Judaism, >      Zoerasterism, Shintoism, and Islam should fit this bit of logic >      quite nicely... :-)  All have depth, all have enduring values, >      thus all must be true...  This is a good point. But more of a good point for studying religion than ignoring it. Some Christians disagree with me, but it is worthwhile to study different religions and philosophies and glean the truth from them.

You have said something about choices and the scenario gives them. Therefore we have what you define as free will.  Imagine the following. I can do good to other beings, but I cannot harm them. Easily implemented by making everyone appreciate being the object of good deeds, but don't make them long for them, so they can not feel the absence of good as evil.  But whose case am I arguing? It is conceivable, so the omnipotent can do it. Or it would not be omnipotent. If you want logically consistent as well, you have to give up the pet idea of an omnipotent first.

That timer is counting down continuously; if it ever hits zero, that means Galileo hasn't heard from Earth in a suspiciously long time and it may be Galileo's fault... so it's time to go into a fallback mode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances of restoring contact.

Always existing and being the source of the existence of all other beings is not problematic.  But, as you put, Being the source of ""all"" existence, including one's own, would mean that God came from nothing, a concept alien to Christianity and Theism.  It is better to understand the classical concepts of Necessary and Contingent existence.  God exists necessarily, always.  God created contingent beings.

Ah, double-fulfillment.  First of all I would say that I'm not sure all the prophecies had double-fulfillment, e.g., the Isaiah 7:14 prophecy.  I would say that just because this happens on some occasions does not mean it will occur always, especially with regard to NT prophecies. The apostles who quoted the OT and applied those passages to Jesus were acting as divine messengers and giving the inerrant Word of God to the Church.  No one has that authority today.  No one has the apostolic authority to say that such-and-such a prophecy has double-fulfillment.  If the imagry of Revelation fits with events of the 1st century, it is folly for us to try and make it apply to events 20 centuries later.  -- Tom Albrecht "

I have several friends at the Moscow Aviation Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original announcement.)  For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems. Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev, Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.  I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines for future space craft use.  If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty have e-mail addresses.  However, it takes about a day or so for the receiver to get the message.  They are still a bit antiquated - but they are rapidly changing!

I attended a colloquium at Goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of NASA was talking about what future missions were going to be funded.  I don't remember his name or title off hand and I have discarded the colloquia announcement. In any case, he was asked about that very matter: ""Why can't we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going?""  His responce was that there are only so many $ available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a COBE, Magellan, Hubble, etc is 5-10 years minumum.  If he spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future projects.  If he did that, sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular, however starting a few years after he had retired he would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments.  Just as he had benefited from his predicessor's funding choices, he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions, even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them.   -- Covert C Beach dragon@access.digex.com "

Well, I could use the argument that some here use about ""nature"" and claim that you cannot have superhuman powers because you are a human; superhuman powers are beyond what a human has, and since you are a human, any powers you have are not beyond those of a human.  Hence, you cannot have superhuman powers.  Sound good to you?  Anyway, to the evidence question: it depends on the context.  In this group, since you are posting from a american college site, I'm willing to take it as given that you have a pair of blue jeans.  And, assuming there is some coherency in your position, I will take it as a given that you do not have superhuman powers.  Arguments are evidence in themselves, in some respects.  >When you say the ""existence of [ sic ] Jesus"", I assume that you >mean just the man, without any special powers, etc.  Yep.  >Many will agree that it is very possible that a man called Jesus DID >in fact live. In fact, I am willing to agree that there was some man named >Jesus. I have no reason to believe that there wasn't ever a man.  Good.  >However, most of the claims ARE extradinary: eg virgin birth >[ virgin in the sense of not having any sexual intercourse ], resurection, >Son of God, etc. THOSE claims require extra evidence.  ""Extra"" evidence?  Why don't we start with evidence at all?  I cannot see any evidence for the V. B. which the cynics in this group would ever accept.  As for the second, it is the foundation of the religion. Anyone who claims to have seen the risen Jesus (back in the 40 day period) is a believer, and therefore is discounted by those in this group; since these are all ancients anyway, one again to choose to dismiss the whole thing.  The third is as much a metaphysical relationship as anything else-- even those who agree to it have argued at length over what it *means*, so again I don't see how evidence is possible.  I thus interpret the ""extraordinary claims"" claim as a statement that the speaker will not accept *any* evidence on the matter. -- C.

I don't claim to be an expert on the branch Davidians, but I might know more than most.  The Branch Davidian group (led by Koresh) is actually one of two off-shoots of a group known as the Shephard's Rod.  The Shephard's Rod (now defunct as far as I know)broke off from the SDA Church in the 30's.  The Shephard's Rod broke away from the SDA Church because they felt that the SDA Church was becoming weak and falling into apostacy.  They felt that they were the remnant spoken about in Revelation.  About the Koresh group, Koresh gained control of it in 1987 or 1988.  Once in control, he made himself the center of it. He proclaimed himself as Christ.  Koresh himself came from an SDA background. He was excommunicated as a young adult by the local congregation for trying to exert too much control over the youth in the church.  After this, he joined the Branch Davidians.  They were/are a survivalist cult. This is why they had the stockpile of weapons, food, a bomb shelter, etc.  They had no intent of raiding the US government or anything. They were preparing for Armaggedon and were putting themselves in a self defense position.  In my opinion, if the ATF and the FBI had left well enough alone, we wouldn' t have the blood of 20+ children crying out from the ashes in Waco.  If you want to know about The Shephard's Rod, you might want to visit the local SDA church and talk to some of the older people.  They could give you some insight into where Koresh got his theology.

Probably we would have much the same problems with only a slight shift in emphasis.  Weekends might not be so inviolate (more common to work 7 days a week in a business), and instead of American Atheists, we would have similar, religious organizations.  A persons religious belief seems more as a crutch and justification for actions than a guide to determine actions.

No, gravity is an inherent system.  You don't need any excess information other than observations to determine anything.  It is possible to objectively determine someone's guilt or innocence within an non-inherent system. I agree that morality is not necessarily inherent (unless you state that everything we do has an evolutionary basis), but this does not mean that it cannot be objective in theory.  >This ""natural morality"" is not an objective system, as evidenced by >your comments about lions, and mine.  Perhaps it can be objective, but not inherent.  Anyway, as I noted before, the practices related to mating rituals, etc. among the animals are likely the only ones to be considered ""immoral"" under the previous ""definitions"" of the natural law.  Therefore, some revisions are in order, since the class of activities surrounding mating seem to pose some general problems.  >>And in fact, the only way that the postulates could be determined by an >>outsider would be if there were some sort of higher truth, like some >>sort of god or something.

See the discussion of ""high-power rocketry"" in the rec.models.rockets frequently-asked-questions list.  This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high- power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.  You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not especially hard to arrange.  As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which eliminates the major safety hazard of do-it-yourself rocketry. -- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry "

I would go further, and say that much of the damage to the environment has been caused by the secular worldview, or by the humanist worldview, and especially by the secular humanist worldview.  This is not to say that ALL secular humanists are necessarily avid destroyers of the environment, and I am sure that there are many who are concerned about the environment. But at the time of the Renaissance and Ref ormation in Western Europe man became the centre, or the focus of culture (hence ""humanism""). This consciousness was also secular, in the sense that it was concerned primarily with the present age, r ather than the age to come. Capitalism arose at the same time, and the power of economics became central in philosophy. This doesn't mean that economics did not exist before, simply that it began to dominate the conscious cultural values of Western European society and its offshoots. This cultural shift was, in its later stages, accompanied by industrial revolutions and the values that justified them.  There was a fundamental cultural shift in the meaning of ""economics"" - from the Christian view of man as the economos, the steward, of creation to the secular idea of man as the slave of economic forces and powers. There were denominational differences among the new worshippers of Mammon. For some the name of the deity was ""the free rein of the market mechanism"", while for others it was ""the dialectical forces of history"". But in both the capitalist West and the socialist East the environment was sacrificed on the altar of Mammon. The situation was mitigated in the West because thos e who were concerned about the damage to the environment had more freedom to oppose what was happening and state their case.

The meetings were part of ""Space VLBI Week"" held at JPL in early March and were intended to maintain cooperation between international space agencies participating in the development of the U.S. Space VLBI Project, a recently approved JPL flight project set for launch in 1995. U.S. Space VLBI will utilize two Earth-orbiting spacecraft -- the Japanese VSOP (VLBI Space Observing Program) satellite with its 8-meter radio telescope, and a Russian RADIOASTRON 10-meter satellite. Both spacecraft will team up with ground-based radio telescopes located around the world to create a radio telescope network that astronomers hope will expand radio telescope observing power by a factor of 10. Japan's VSOP satellite will use a limited six-hour orbit to conduct imaging science, while the Russian RADIOASTRON spacecraft will exploit a larger, 28-hour Earth orbit to conduct exploratory radio astronomy. Each satellite will point at a source target for roughly 24 hours, while approximately 20 ground-based radio telescopes will simultaneously point at the same source object while within view on Earth. According to Dr. Joel Smith, JPL's project manager for the U.S. Space VLBI, meetings like those held at JPL will permit Japan and Russia, who have little previous experience in radio interferometry, to establish working relationships with the radio astronomy communities that will be vital during the complex observations required by the Space VLBI project. ""One of our main activities is developing the methodology for international coordination, because the two spacecraft simultaneously rely on the corresponding tracking stations while using the ground-based radio telescopes to observe the same celestial objects,"" said Smith. Three new tracking antennas are being built at DSN facilities and other three other tracking facilities located in Japan, Russia and Green Bank, W.Va. This global network of ground-based radio telescopes will use precision clocks and high-speed recorders to collect observation data and forward the information to a correlator located at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Socorro, N.M. The correlator will combine and process data, then make it available to mission investigators in Moscow, Tokyo, and JPL via electronic mail. Smith is optimistic that the massive radio telescope created by the Space VLBI network will provide radio astronomers with better resolution than has ever been achieved before by ground-based radio telescopes, allowing astronomers to take a closer look at distant objects in space. ""There is a long history of radio astronomy using ground-based telescopes,"" said Smith. ""What we intend to do is to extend radio astronomy into Earth orbit. Our goal is to look deeper into the cores of galactic nuclei, quasars and other active radio sources to understand what drives those things we have seen so far with radio astronomy."" Smith noted that if one examines ""the active galactic nuclei, you'll find jets appearing to spew at speeds greater than light, and at energy levels that are millions of times greater than you would expect."" He said some astronomers believe that black holes may be located in the cores of these galaxies, and that they may fuel the jets. Smith hopes that ""by using Space VLBI to look further into the cores, this theory may be supported or disproved."" Russian space-flight hardware, including transponders and transmitters, are now being tested in the United States, and Japanese hardware is scheduled to arrive for testing later this year. Analysis of this hardware will permit U.S. scientists and engineers to understand how to modify the high-speed VLBA Correlator operating at the NRAO in order to accommodate the odd data patterns that will originate from the more than 20 ground-based radio telescopes involved in Space VLBI. Smith is particularly pleased that meetings with the Japanese and Russian space agency officials -- like those held at JPL in March -- have proceeded smoothly. Yet he knows that the political uncertainty in Russia could jeopardize that country's participation in the project. ""Nothing is ever smooth,"" he said, ""but the Russians have been incredibly open with us. We always anticipated some likelihood that we will not succeed because of political factors beyond our control, yet there tends to be a way of keeping these things going, because scientists on both sides are trying hard, and people recognize the value of cooperation at this level."" Smith points out that the Japanese space agency has more at stake than just fulfilling an international commitment to a science mission. ""The Japanese have been extremely cooperative, since international cooperation is essential to their science mission,"" he said. But Smith also noted that Japanese space agency officials look at the U.S. Space VLBI mission as an opportunity to showcase the technology involved with VSOP spacecraft, and their highly regarded Mach V launch vehicle. Yet regardless of the risks involved in undertaking such an ambitious project, JPL's Smith is satisfied that planning for the Space VLBI Project is beyond the significant financial and political hurdles that otherwise might threaten the project. ""Fortunately, we have the virtue of having two partners, and if either falls out, we would still have something with the other. By themselves, both spacecraft are independent, scientifically exciting missions."" ### ___    _____     ___ /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth, you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer. A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community.  It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'. Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000 for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers, or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.

soc.religion.christian	" From: JEK@cu.nih.gov Subject: etymology of ""Easter"" Lines: 53  for SRC  In most languages, the Feast of the Resurrection of Our Lord is known as the PASCH, or PASQUE, or some variation thereof, a word which comes from the Hebrew PESACH, meaning ""Passover."" In English, German, and a few related languages, however, it is known as EASTER, or some variation thereof, and questions have been asked about the origin of this term.  One explanation is that given by the Venerable Bede in his DE RATIONE TEMPORUM 1:5, where he derives the word from the name of an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring called EASTRE. Bede is a great scholar, and it is natural to take his word for it. But he lived 673-735, and Augustine began preaching in Kent in 597. The use of the word EASTER to describe the Feast would have been well established before the birth of Bede and probably before the birth of anyone he might have discussed the subject with. It seems likely that his derivation is just a guess, based on his awareness that there had been an Anglo-Saxon goddess of Spring bearing that name, and the resemblance of the words. Thus, if the said resemblance (surely it is not surprising that a personification of Spring should have a name similar to the word for Dawn) is not in istelf convincing, the testimony (or rather the conjecture) by Bede does not make it more so.  Assuming that Bede was right, that would not justify saying that the Christian celebration (which, after all, had been going on for some centuries before the name EASTER was applied to it) has pagan roots. It would simply mean that the Anglo-Saxons, upon becoming Christians and beginning to celebrate the Resurrection by a festival every spring, called it by the name that to them meant simply ""Spring Festival.""  However, Bede's is not the only theory that has been proposed.  J Knoblech, in ""Die Sprach,"" ZEITSCHRIFT FUER SPRACHWISSENSCHAFT 5 (Vienna, 1959) 27-45, offers the following derivation:  Among Latin-speaking Christians, the week beginning with the Feast of the Resurrection was known as ""hebdomada alba"" (white week), since the newly-baptized Christians were accustomed to wear their white baptismal robes throughout that week. Sometimes the week was referred to simply as ""albae."" Translaters rendering this into German mistook it for the plural of ""alba,"" meaning ""dawn."" They accordingly rendered it as EOSTARUM, which is Old High German for ""dawn."" This gave rise to the form EASTER in English.  Yours, James Kiefer   [No, I'm not interested in restarting discussions of the propriety of celebrating Easter.  However this seems like it contains enough interesting information that people might like to see it.  --clh] "

Societal morality is necessarily very crude and broad-brush stuff which attempts to deal with what is necessary to keep that society going  - and often it's a little over-enthusiastic about doing so.  Individual morality is a different thing, it often includes societal mores (or society is in trouble), but is stronger.

What right do we have to interfere?  IMO, it isn't often that interference (i.e. jail, and force of various kinds and degrees) is both necessary and effective.  Where you derive the right to interfere is a difficult question - it's a sort of liar's paradox: ""force is necessary for freedom"".

Nobuya ""Higgy"" Higashiyama replied (as, in substance, did others):  > Where is your source of moral standards by which you judge God's > behavior?  It is often argued that we have no standing by which to judge God's actions.  Who is the clay to talk back to the potter? But we find a contrary view in Scripture. When God proposes to destroy the city of Sodom (Genesis 18), Abraham says:  + Suppose that there are some good men in the city. + Will you destroy the righteous along with the wicked? + Far be it from you, Lord, to do such a thing! + Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?  I am told that the Hebrew is actually a bit stronger than this, and can perhaps be better rendered (dynamic equivalence) as  + Shame on you, Lord, if you do such a thing!  There are those who say that the definition of ""good"" is ""whatever God happens to want."" But if that is so, then the statement that God is good has no meaning.  It simply says that God does what He wants. That being the case, no one can either love or obey God because He is good. The only motive left for obeying Him is that He is powerful. Just as it makes sense to obey a dictator, even when he tells you to round up all Jews and exterminate them, because if you defy him you might end up in the gas chamber yourself, so it makes sense to obey God, because He has the power to punish you if you don't. This ethical theory I take to be in radical contradiction to Genesis 18 and to Christianity in general.  Any theory that makes our moral judgements worthless makes any further discussion of morality (or of the goodness of God) meaningless. However, it does not follow that our moral judgements are always infallible in particular cases, still less our judgements in particular cases about the course of action most likely to achieve a good result.  When I read the Scriptural accounts of the actions of God in history, those actions often seem to me very different from what I might expect of a God who loves us and desires what is best for us. Moreover, leaving the Scriptures aside, and considering the natural world, I find that Nature is often very different from what I might expect if it were the work of a benevolent deity.  (Origen said: ""Those who believe that the Author of Nature is also the Author of the Scriptures must expect to find in the Scriptures the same sort of difficulties that they find in Nature."")  Now, that some such difficulties should exist is not in itself an argument against the existence, power, wisdom, and goodness of God. On the contrary, their ABSENCE would be such an argument. Suppose that I am watching Bobby Fisher play chess, and suppose that every time he makes a move, I find myself nodding and saying: ""Good move! Just what I was expecting him to do.  Same move I would have made if I were playing."" That would be a sign that Fisher is no better a chess player than myself. Given that he is better, I expect that at least some of his moves will have me thinking, ""Now, what do suppose induced him to do that?"" or even, ""Boy, that was a real slip -- he's just thrown the game away!"" Similarly, if God understands the workings of the universe better than I do, it is to be expected that sometimes it will look to me as if He has made a mistake.  One difference between Fisher at the chessboard and God at the controls of the universe is that I can see the end of the chess game. If Fisher wins, I revise my earlier inference that it was carelessness that made him lose his queen 23 moves earlier. However, if he loses, and particularly if I can see that there was a time when he had an opportunity for a checkmate in two moves and did not take it, then I know that he is not as good a player as I had thought.  With God, on the other hand, I shall not in this life see the total result of some of His actions. Therefore, my grounds for judging that I have seen a bad move on His part must always be far shakier than my grounds for making a similar judgement about Fisher.  *****     *****     *****     *****     *****  In the book of Genesis, we read that Joseph's ten older brothers, who (with good reason) found  him insufferable, conspired to sell him into slavery in Egypt. There he eventually became Viceroy, and when there was a famine in Canaan, he was able to provide for his family. When his brothers nervously apologized, he told them: ""Do not worry. You meant to do me evil, but God turned it into good.""  I once heard a rabbi speak on this text. He said:  The history of the Jews is largely a history of events that look like catastrophes that threaten the continued survival of the religion, or the people, or both. But, amazingly, those events turn out to be the saving of the Jews and of Judaism. The sale of Joseph by his brothers looked like the breakup of the family.  But in fact, it ended with a reconciliation of the quarrel between them. The famine that drove the family out of Canaan looked like a misfortune for them.  But in fact, if they had stayed in Canaan, they would almost certainly have intermarried with the Canaanites and been assimilated into their culture.  Their oppression by the Egyptians a few generations after their arrival in Egypt again looked like a disaster. But God used it to bring them out of Egypt, and into the Promised Land. Here the people built a Temple, and regularly offered sacrifices. But the Babylonians captured Jerusalem and Judea, destroyed Temple and city and countryside, and deported most of the people to Babylon. You might have thought that that would be the end of the people and the religion. But it was not. Living in Canaan, the people had been under constant danger of assimilation.  Again and again, they had turned from the worship of the LORD to the worship of the Canaanite fertility cults, with their ritual prostitution and ritual human sacrifice. The Babylonian captivity put a stop to that. Never again did the Jews show any interest in polytheism or idolatry. Neither the worship of the Canaanites mor that of the Babylonians ever again had a foothold among them. Nor is that all. Judaism had been in danger of becoming simply a system of sacrifices and Temple observances. The only prescribed acts of worship consisted of coming to Jerusalem every so often and offering a sacrifice. During the Captivity, with the Temple gone, the Jews invented the synagogue, a place of meeting for reading and study and discussion of the Scriptures. They came to realize clearly, what they were in danger of forgetting while they continued to live in Judea, that God is not simply a local or tribal deity, not just the controller of the land of Canaan, or the patron of the Jewish people, but the Creator of the world, and the Ruler and Judge of all humans everywhere. Time passed, and the Babylonian Empire was replaced by that of the Persians, and then that of the Greeks, or rather the Macedonians. The ruler, Antiochus Epiphanes, was determined to stamp out Judaism, and to this end he made the reading and the study of the Torah punishable by death. Again, one might think that this would be the end of Judaism. But it was not. The people met for worship, and instead of reading the Torah portion appointed for the day, they would read some passage from the prophets that had a similar theme, and then discuss that.  Before this time, the Torah, the so-called Five Books of Moses (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) were the only books read and studied in the synagogue.  If it had not been for Antiochus, the books of the prophets would probably have been forgotten altogether. His hatred for Judaism saved them.  [Other examples here omitted for brevity's sake.]  Some of you may remember that Julie Andrews first became famous as Eliza Doolittle in the stage production of MY FAIR LADY. When Warner Brothers undertook to make a movie of it, everyone expected that Julie, who had been so magnificent on stage, would play the same role in the movie. Instead, the studio decided to go with an established screen star, and cast Audrey Hepburn.  Julie Andrews was naturally crushed. But she later realized that if she had played the screen role, she would have been type-cast for life as an Elize Doolittle type. It would have been a disaster for her. As it was, Walt Disney offered her the role of Mary Poppins, and she won an Oscar for it.  At the presentation, she stood there, smiling, and looking at Walt Disney, she said, ""And now, my special thanks to the man who made all this possible -- JACK WARNER!"" It was the most memorable line of the evening. In a similar spirit, we Jews might thank the men who in the providence of God have preserved Judaism, and kept it alive to this day, beginning with Joseph's brothers, and continuing with two Pharaohs, with Nebuchadnezzar, with Antiochus Epiphanes....  After the formal meeting had broken up, one woman came up to him privately and said, ""You were talking about the Holocaust, weren't you?"" He answered, ""If that is an example that came to your mind, then you are right, I was talking about it to you. But I would not talk about it to everyone, for not everyone can bear it."" I assume that he meant that, without the Holocaust, there would have been no state of Israel.  Someone hearing the rabbi's lecture might leap to the conclusion that God is dependent on the wickedness of men to accomplish His purposes -- or at least that the rabbi thought so. He might then  go on to suppose that the wickedness is in fact God's doing -- that He stirred up Joseph's brothers to a murderous hate against him, and that when the Israelites were in Egypt, God hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he oppressed the people, and would not let them go. And this raises questions about how an action can be considered wicked and at the same time be considered something that God has brought about.  I suggest another way of looking at it. Consider a sculptor who has a log of wood from which he proposes to carve a statue. But the log, instead of having a smooth even grain throughout, has a large knot that spoils the appearance of the surface. The sculptor considers the wood for a while, and then carves a statue that features the knot, that makes that particular interruption in the grain and color of the wood correspond to some feature of the statue, so that observers will say: ""How fortunate the sculptor was in finding a piece of wood with a knot like that in just the right place. Its presence is the crowning touch, the thing that makes the statue a great work of art."" In reality, the knot, far from being what the sculptor was looking for, was a challenge to his skill. If the wood had not contained that flaw, he would still have made a great work of art, but a different one. So, if Joseph's brothers had not sold him, God would still have brought about His purposes for the Jewish people, but He would have done so in another manner. If Judas had not betrayed Jesus, if Caiaphas and his fellow leaders had not rejected Jesus, but had rather acknowledged Him as the Annointed of God, if Pilate had followed his conscience rather than his fears and had set Jesus free, it might appear that there would have been no Crucifixion, and therefore no Redemption, and therefore no Salvation. Not so. God did not need Judas' sin to redeem us. If Judas had done right, then God in Christ would still have reconciled the world to Himself.  We do not know how, just as we do not know how Michelangelo would have painted the Sistine Chapel if its interior had instead been shaped like Grand Central Station, and just as we do not know how Bobby Fisher would have won his fourth game agianst Spassky if Spassky had refused the exchange of bishops and had attacked Fisher's knight instead (don't bother to look up the game in question--I am making up this example, but the point is none the less valid).  Thus, we may say both (1) that God used, say, the cowardice of Pilate to accomplish His purposes, and (2) that the said cowardice was not God's doing, and that Pilate would not have thwarted God's plans by behaving justly and courageously.  What, then, are we to make of the place where God says to Moses, ""I will harden Pharaoh's heart, so that he will not let the people go""? Some Christians have taken this to mean that Pharaoh was a puppet with God pulling the strings, and that his stubbornness and cruelty were not his own work, but the work of God in him. I suppose rather that what God was telling Moses was something like this: ""If you see that Pharaoh is not willing to let the people go, do not be discouraged, or suppose that the situation is out of my control. My purposes will not be thwarted. If Pharaoh chooses to hear you and let the people go, well and good. If he does not, I will fit his resistance into my plans, and fit it so perfectly that future historians and theologians will suppose that I would have been thrown for a loss if Pharaoh had obeyed me.""  To return to the question that started this all off. Is it possible that the Serbs, in slaughtering the Moslems of Bosnia, are instruments of God's will? First point. What they are doing is wrong, just as what Joseph's brothers did was wrong, just as what Judas did was wrong. They intend it for evil. If God somehow brings good out of it, that does not make them any less subject to just condemnation and punishment. Second point. Of course, God will bring good out of it. But not the same good that He would have brought if the Serbians had refrained from the sins of robbery and rape and murder. Nor does the good He purposes excuse us from the duty of doing what is right.  Yours, James Kiefer "

GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god, the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche. God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to live with him on the wrong in your life. Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John 3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that through him it might be saved."" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all. for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you. i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to Hell? that step is much more rewarding.  stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu my opinions are my own, you may borrow them  p.s. stay in touch and keep asking questions not just to us but to God as well, he listens too.

I'll pose a question here that's got me thinking:  what distinguishes ""true"" religion from cults (I'm speaking generally here, not specifially about Christianity)?  Jerry Falwell was on Good Morning America on Tuesday ostensibly to answer this question.  Basically, he said that true religion follows a message whereas a cult follows a person. But, then, Christianity is a cult because the message of Christianity IS the person of Jesus.  So what distinguishes, for example, the Branch Davidian ""cult"" from the Presbyterian ""church""?

Let us say a little The ONLY unity I've found which is true is when all parties involved are disciples.  I came out of a church in which even the different congregations were always competing and arguing about which one was better and who had the better messages (while none of them put anything into practice from those messages).  Since becoming a disciple, I've found that when I travel to another church in the same movement, they are just as accepting there as any other.  We had a retreat back in January when some of the congregation from Louisville, KY came up (this retreat was for college students) and it was as though I had known even the people from Louisville for years (and I had only become a disciple the previous April and had never been to the church in Kentucky).  One of the keys to unity is unselfish love and self-sacrifice.  That is only one area in which disciples stand out from ""Christians"".  Also, another part of unity is a common depth of conviction.  I've also been a part of some ""Christian"" campus fellowships who were focused on unity between churches and saw that those churches had one thing involved:  a lack of conviction about everything they believed.  That was why they could be unified, they didn't care about the truth but delighted in getting along together.  >The problem here in The Netherlands is that there are two other churches >(denominations) with the same characteristics.

What need is there of creeds when the Bible stands firmly better?  >So, here is a first question: >- can the congregation of Christ be separated by walls of different >  denominations? Or is this definitely an untolerable situation >  according to the Scriptures?  According to the Scriptures, splits and differences of opinion are going to be there.  As per a previous note, I mentioned that there are those who teach falsely by many means.  There are also differences of opinion and belief.  However, Scripture states: In the following directives I have no praise for you, for your meetings do more harm than good.  In the first place, I hear that when you come together as a church, there re divisions among you, and to some extent I believe it.  No doubt there have to be differences among you to show which of you have God's approval (1 Corinthians 11:17-19).  How will God show his approval?  By fruitfulness (see Acts 2:47), but before that, there are these qualities: devotion to the apostles teaching fellowship communion filling with awe for God all having everything in common. glad and sincere hearts praising God enjoying the favor of the people All these are mentioned in Acts 2:42-47.  God also shows that those who have these qualities are persecuted.  Look at Stephen, ""a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit"" (Acts 6:5) who was later stoned (Acts 7:54-60).  >- can one say that only one of these three churches is the >  true church of Jesus Christ?  One can say that a church is the true church only if that church is perfect not only in the congregation but worldwide as a movement.  I have yet to find that, but the closest one I've found is the Boston Church of Christ movement, which constantly strives to have errors pointed out and corrected.  It is also the only one I've seen which is totally sold out to God.  > >A problem closely related to these question is: >- can we cooperate with other Christians - from these two churches - >  before there is a unity? This question is especially important >  for those who think that only one church can be the ""true one"". > As for cooperation, that can always occur.  Unity, on the other hand may never occur.  As for those who think about only one church being the ""true one"", I remind them that Mark 9:38-41 states that there are disciples who are not a part of the main group to begin with, but they will not lose their reward.  As with the Boston movement, I've heard numerous times this exact same thing, that there are disciples out there that are not a part of the Boston movement but that does not make them any less disciples.  Of course, few people admit that they've ever run into someone who has the qualities of a disciple outside the movement. I know I haven't.  >Maybe this last problem sounds a little strange to most of you. >For your information: we have a lot of organizations here which >are founded by people of one specific church and whose members >are all members of that church.

In one of the churches I attended, for example, there was an internal clique of people who were on the 14 different groups/committees/organizational heads of the congregation.  They rarely talked to anyone else outside of the committees and seldom were voted out of office without another office being ""opened up"" so that they would have to step right back in. Their degree of exclusion was such that when the new pastor came, he nearly had to wipe out everything and start from scratch (I wish he would've since they still have no clue about what it means to be a disciple).  Anyway, this rigidity in the clique is beginning to be broken down, but is still there.  So, I must warn against such division within.  There's enough division without.  >Thanks for your opinions in advance! > >Maarten  Joe Fisher "

Or be a Buddhist? The Buddha's commandments are 500 yrs older than Christ's and in my opinion tougher to follow. Moreover the Buddha says that we are intrinsically good (as against Christ's ""we are all sinners""). Only we allow ourselves to be distracted. By meditating we can awaken ourselves (etc etc). Also there is no concept of God in Buddhism. (In my opinion you can be an Atheist and a Buddhist). But to ""awaken"" yourself is no easy task. Can you stay away from eating meat? Can you sit still and think of nothing (meditate) for sometime everyday? Buddhists do (or are supposed to). Can you pray five times a day? Can you fast for a month every year (Ramzan). Are you willing to give 1/6 th of your income as tithe? Muslims do. In fact I think Jesus was an ordinary man (just as Buddha and Mohamed) probably with a philosopy ahead of the times (where he lived). Considering the fact that Christianity is a young religion (compared to Hindiusm, Judaism, Zorasterism, Buddihsm) it is also very probable that the Bible is merely a collection of borrowed ideas. (There was a good deal of trade between the eastern lands and the middle east at the time of Christ). And perhaps some more.

No one was ever flogged, beaten, burned, fed to the lions, or killed in any other way because of a belief in the resurrection - sorry to disappoint you. The idea of resurrection is one which can be found in a host of different forms in the religions of antiquity.  The problem was not the resurrection which was a mediorce issue for a tiny fragment of the Jewish population (the Saducees) but was a non issues for everyone else.  The real problem was that Christians were pacifist and preached there was only one god.  When the state operates by a system of divinitation of the emperor -  monotheism becomes a capital offense.  The Jews were able to get exemption from this, and were also not evangelistic.  Christians were far more vocal, and gentile, and hence dangerous and were therefore targets of persecution.  Also since Christians were a relatively powerless group, they made good scapegoats as is seen by Nero's blaming them for the burning of Rome.  Let's not cloud the issues with the resurrection.  randy  [I agree with you that Christians were not persecuted specifically because they believed in resurrection.  However the beliefs that did cause trouble were dependent on belief in the resurrection of Jesus. Of course the problem with it is that there are alternatives other than a great conspiracy.  The most common theory among non-Christians scholars seems to be that the resurrection was a subjective event -- in effect, a delusion.  --clh] "

Sorry to disappoint you, but I'm afraid your friendship is in danger. Perhaps you should examine in yourself why as such a good friend, you are unwilling to accept this imortant part of your friends life?  Why do you call into question his faith?  Your friend has changed, he has found something that fills a need in his life.  You need to decide if you are still his friend, whether you can accommodate his new life. It sounds as if you are criticizing him for a fundamental belief in the Bible, yet you are quick to reveal that your fundamental belief that it is superstition.  Perhaps if he knew you at least took him seriously, that you at least took an interest in the light he has found, that you at least tried to understand what has become a special part of his life, you could together decide to become fundamentalists, respect each others differences and remain friends, or part ways.  Maybe even if you stuck it out with him, you could help him to un-convert.  Of course, if you go in with that attitude he will surely see through your intentions and begin to resent you.  I happen to be a person very tolerant of fundamentalists, because I know that the idea of a simple black and white approach to life is appealing. I don't happen to share the beliefs of fundamentalists, but I am not offended by their prosyletizing.  I had a few good conversations with some Witnesses who came to my door.  I didn't switch my beliefs, but for those at home who maybe need a friendly face to invite them somewhere, the Witnesses provide a wonderful service.  You may have been conditioned to believe that religion is unimportant and witnessing is obnoxious, but why?  Are you afraid you might be converted and become one of them, that you will be swept up in fundamentalism, that you will become a weirdo. Friendship's a two-way street.  You must respect your friend, ALL of him, including his beliefs, if you want the friendship to continue.  Joe Moore

[ . . . ]  Having lived through the kicking and screaming in the 60s and 70s as the Catholics were invited to participate in the liturgy instead of counting their rosary beads during Mass, I find this comment interesting.  There is a _massively_ longer tradition for proclaiming the Passion accounts without active participation.  If you know the Latin, one really beautiful way to hear the Passion is it's being chanted by three deacons:  the Narrator chants in the middle baritone range, Jesus chants in the bass, and others directly quoted are handled by a high tenor. This is actually the basis for the common proclamation of the Passion that John would prefer.  But there is always a judgement call based on pastoral considerations. Each pastor makes his own decisions (it isn't a church-wide conspiracy against participation).  The Palm Sunday liturgy, with its initial blessing and distribution of the palms and procession, is already getting long before you get to the Passion; some pastors feel that they should not make the people stand through that long narrative.  Also, the orchestrated proclamation with multiple readers and public participation in the crowd quotations runs longer than the single-reader proclamation --- in churches with multiple Masses for the Sunday, it might be necessary to go with the briefer options just to ""get 'em in and get 'em out"".  Each parish is different.  Catholics are no longer canonically tied to their geographic parishes.  It is possible that another Catholic parish in the Columbus area (based on the Ohio State address) has a liturgy closer to your preferences.  Or talk to some of your fellow parishioners and see how common your preferences are --- pastors generally ARE willing to listen to non-confrontational requests.  Though you probably should bring along a paramedic in case he reacts too strongly to the shock of people asked for a _longer_ Sunday Mass.  Perhaps the problem is that recent liturgical development hasn't follow the continuous evolution model (the accumulation of small changes, no single one of which is too hard to take) but rather the punctuated equilibrium model (things stay the same and we get accustomed to them, then the marked mutation hits).  {My apologies if I am mis-remembering the names of the evolutionary theories.} -- --- Tim Rolfe rolfe@dsuvax.dsu.edu rolfe@junior.dsu.edu RolfeT@columbia.dsu.edu "

I can see, however, how our prayer life might be hindered by our sin, if we are concentrating on what is causing the sin or what has happened, we may not be thinking about prayer, thus our prayers are 'hindered' by our own actions.

soc.religion.christian	" From: aa888@freenet.carleton.ca (Mark Baker) Subject: Re: The arrogance of Christians Reply-To: aa888@freenet.carleton.ca (Mark Baker) Organization: The National Capital Freenet Lines: 58  In a previous article, dleonar@andy.bgsu.edu (Pixie) says:  >     Do the words ""Question Authority"" mean anything to you? > >     I defy any theist to reply.  Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.  You have to be very careful about what you mean by ""question authority"". Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative, and to say ""I question to word of this authority"" is ridiculous. If it is open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase here should be ""authenticate authority."" Once you have authenticated your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as an authority.  The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.) I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must do it by some means other than by examining its teachings.  In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to verify for himself.  In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).  The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty. If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific.  To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very nature, prove anything.    -- ============================================================================== Mark Baker                  | ""The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts."" -- C.

These aren't, in a strict sense, amateur rockets. That term denotes rockets, the engines of which are constructed by the user. The rockets you describe are called HPR, or high power rockets, to distinguish them from (smaller) model rockets. They use factory-made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles. The engines are classified by impulse. A ""D"" engine, for example, can have no more than 20 newton-seconds of impulse. An ""F"" engine can have no more than 40 ns. Each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse. So far, engines up to size ""O"" are available pretty much off the shelf. Engines of size H and above are shipped as Class B explosives, and as such are controlled. Engines of size F and below are shipped as Class C explosives, and are not as controlled. Class F engines, BTW, are not HPR engines, but model rocket engines. (Class G engines go in and out of legal limbo.)  There is an HPR Society, The Tripoli Rocket Society, I believe, which holds events at various sites throughout the year, with all legalities (FAA waiver included) taken care of. The National Association of Rocketry is more concerned with engines below H, though it is involved in HPR as well. These societies certify users of HPR rockets, and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals.  Bottom Line: It's legit.

A question for you - can you give me the name of an organization or a philosophy or a political movement, etc., which has never had anything evil done in its name?  You're missing a central teaching of Christianity - man is inherently sinful.  We are saved through faith by grace.  Knowing that, believing that, does not make us without sin.  Furthermore, not all who consider themselves ""christians"" are (even those who manage to head their own ""churches"").

Well, it's really a shame you feel this way.  No one can browbeat you into believing, and those who try will probably only succeed in driving you further away.  You need to ask yourself some difficult questions: 1) is there an afterlife, and if so, does man require salvation to attain it.  If the answer is yes, the next question is 2) how does man attain this salvation - can he do it on his own as the eastern religions and certain modern offshoots like the ""new age movement"" teach or does he require God's help?  3) If the latter, in what form does - indeed, in what form can such help come?  Needless to say, this discussion could take a lifetime, and for some people it did comprise their life's writings, so I am hardly in a position to offer the answers here - merely pointers to what to ask.  Few, of us manage to have an unshaken faith our entire lives (certainly not me).

You wrote that ""I (in my own faith) accept and live my life by many if not most of the teachings of christ"".  Well, Christ referred to God as ""My Father"", not ""My Mother"", and while the ""maleness"" of God is not the same as the maleness of those of us humans who possess a Y chromosome, it does not honor God to refer to Him as female purely to be trendy, non-discriminatory, or politically correct.  This in no way disparages women (nor is it my intent to do so by my use of the male pronoun to refer to both men and women - english just does not have a decent neuter set of pronouns).  After all, God chose a woman as his only human partner in bringing Christ into the human population.  Well, I'm not about to launch into a detailed discussion of the role of women in Christianity at 1am with only 6 hours of sleep in the last 63, and for that reason I also apologize for any shortcomings in this article.

Which means that by beliefs about God are directly related to my experience of God.  Having experienced God, I try to make sense of that experience.  I study religion and read the Bible.

soc.religion.christian	 From: 18669@bach.udel.edu (Steven R Hoskins) Subject: Some questions from a new Christian Organization: University of Delaware Lines: 40  Hi,  I am new to this newsgroup, and also fairly new to christianity. I was raised as a Unitarian and have spent the better part of my life as an agnostic, but recently I have developed the firm conviction that the Christian message is correct and I have accepted Jesus into my life. I am happy, but I realize I am very ignorant about much of the Bible and quite possibly about what Christians should hold as true. This I am trying to rectify (by reading the Bible of course), but it would be helpful to also read a good interpretation/commentary on the Bible or other relevant aspects of the Christian faith. One of my questions I would like to ask is - Can anyone recommend a good reading list of theological works intended for a lay person?  I have another question I would like to ask. I am not yet affiliated with any one congregation. Aside from matters of taste, what criteria should one use in choosing a church? I don't really know the difference between the various Protestant denominations.  Thanks for reading my post.  Sincerely,  Steve Hoskins  [Aside from a commentary, you might also want to consider an introduction.  These are books intended for use in undergraduate Bible courses.  They give historical background, discussion of literary styles, etc.  And generally they have good bibligraphies for further reading.  I typically recommend Kee, Froehlich and Young's NT introduction.  There are also some good one-volume commentaries.  They often have background articles that are helpful.  Probably the best recommendation these days would be Harper's Bible Commentary.  (I think there may be a couple of books with this title.  This is a fairly recent one, like about 1990, done in cooperation with the Society for Biblical Criticism.)  If you are committed to inerrancy, you will probably prefer something more conservative.  I don't read a lot of conservative books, but a commentary I looked at by Donald Guthrie looked rather good.  He has a NT Introduction, and he's also editor of Eerdman's Bible Commentary.  --clh]

It doesn't matter if the physical manifestation of C is outside X.  For instance, if I hack into NASA's Ames Research Lab and delete all their files, I have committed a crime in the United Kingdom.  If the US authorities wish to prosecute me under US law rather than UK law, they have no automatic right to do so.  This is why the net authorities in the US tried to put pressure on some sites in Holland.  Holland had no anti-cracking legislation, and so it was viewed as a ""hacker haven"" by some US system administrators.  Similarly, a company called Red Hot Television is broadcasting pornographic material which can be received in Britain.  If they were broadcasting in Britain, they would be committing a crime.  But they are not, they are broadcasting from Denmark, so the British Government is powerless to do anything about it, in spite of the apparent law-breaking.  Of course, I'm not a lawyer, so I could be wrong.  More confusingly, I could be right in some countries but not in others...   mathew "

It happened in La Salle, France.  The moral lesson of the story is:  The Lamb of God has been sacrificed and His blood has been used to cleanse us of our sins every moment as God perceives worthy of being done in Heaven.  Mary weeps for The Lamb and for the rest of her offsprings.  This will continue while we disobey God or sin against Him.  Mary, as a messenger, has been given the task to make us be 'aware' of the evil serpent (communism, wars, famine, unfaithful, disobedience to God, etc.) running after the rest of her offsprings. The children who went astray by disobedience led by the dragon is brought back by her peace and loving messages, reparations for sins, to obey God's commandments and be more worthy to be in the presence of The Lamb.  As she was conceived without sin to be worthy of bearing the Son of God in her womb, Mary has been preparing us, the Church, the Body of Christ, for His second coming (making sure we are protected from the dragon).  Also, she has been preparing the new Eden, by reversing the deed of the ancient Eve.  The new Eden will be the sanctuary of the righteous as judged by Christ in His next coming.  I relate the story again: I believe this and Mary, in one of her apparitions in 19th or 20th century, she appeared to these two children who tends goats and cows (I forgot the exact place).  She was  weeping and telling the children that she is afraid she's ""going to lose her Son's arm"".  She is mourning too for these townfolks because it was their fault that there would be drought in their harvest; not much good food again this year as it was last year.  Mary tells the children: *    Most of the townfolks in this place worked whole    * *    week even on Sundays when they should be in church  * *    honoring God.  These townfolks swears and           * *    uses her Son's name in bad words.  That is          * why her Son's arm is so heavy in pain. Then she asked them if they pray.  The children said ""hardly"".  She asked them to pray every morning and night.  When the children went back from work they had to tell somebody about this. When the news was spred and after thorough *    investigation of the incident, the townfolks        * *    were converted and faith and obedience to God       * *    were restored in their community.                   *   Once again, the Lamb succeeds.  -Marida ""...spreading God's words through actions..."" -Mother Teresa "

My views on this topic have evolved and clarified through this, and I suspect that we may not disagree as much as we think.  I admit that I'm strongly prejudiced against evangelical Christianity, and I may not always be rational in my reactions to it.  I grew up in EC, and went to an EC college.  It was definitely the wrong place for me, and I react strongly to any implication that EC or conservative Christianity has any sort of stronghold on true Christianity.  I shudder when I remember the condescending attitude I had about other Christians who didn't adhere to the EC model.  I have come to see that my real objection to this whole notion of absolute truth is the actions I have seen it lead to.  I have had some very bad experiences with evangelical Christians claiming to know the truth, and judging me or others based on their belief that they have the answers.  Knowing the truth doesn't seem to leave a whole lot of room for others' opinions.  I can accept your belief in absolute truth as long as you* don't try to use that belief to try to force others to comply with it, and you are very careful that you don't hurt others with it.  Love your neighbor seems to go totally out the window when one knows the truth and believes that everyone should be living by that truth.  Other people have convictions about the truth every bit as strong and sincere as yours, based on careful searching, prayer, and their relationship with God. Don't dismiss them because God didn't lead them to the same conclusions as yours.  *This is not directed personally at you, Dean.  Carol Alvin caralv@auto-trol.com

I'm not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx in advance)  I want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There is this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says: ""....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.""  Thanx in advance... Shaz....  [I'm not sure quite what you mean by many different versions. The primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style of the translation.  It's pretty unusual to see significant differences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying text.  That's because before printing, manuscripts were copied by hand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts around that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the original, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are generally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are something like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved, but with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don't think there's much uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians believe that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of translating is free of error.  But I also don't think there's enough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that it has much practical effect.  Whether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot topic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it (though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details that don't affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there being multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in all the versions.  I'm surprised to find a reference to this on the title page though.  What version are you talking about?  I've been referring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get referenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been editions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes everything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into single narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor objects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible has long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making editions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions that are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from a variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine one of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all inaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it's not any edition that's widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is. (Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It's been alleged that a few translations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize inconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there are always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best, I'm afraid.)  --clh] "

Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all, so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.  It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit. If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from what you'd need for the brute-force approach. -- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry "

April 23, 1993 (Phone:  202/358-1780)  Kyle Herring Johnson Space Center, Houston (Phone:  713/483-5111)  RELEASE:  93-76  HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS  The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability for an additional two, if needed.  The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual EVA tasks on previous missions.  ""Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,"" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said. ""It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.""  In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives during the mission.  ""When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays, WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,"" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight Director for the mission.  While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.  ""We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,"" Heflin said.  ""In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible to accomplish the mission objectives.""  Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone underwater training ""runs"" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.  Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.  Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission. The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, Ala.  Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and trainers.  Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.  The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in 1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have become necessary.  - end - ___    _____     ___ /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

I grew up catholic. Up until I was 14, it wasn't an issue for me. Then I met a born-again christian, a very sweet person, not proseletyzing(sp?), not imposing. I tried to get into being as christian as I could, as I felt I 'should'.  But the more I tried, the more depressed I got. I felt guilty for some of my own personal, honest feelings. I tried so hard to reconcile this conflict. until I was 23.  Then I taught myself to think rationally. I read a lot of books, pro and con religion in general and, specifically, catholicism. I came to a crisis point, then it finally clicked and now I am a staunch atheist.  This is a very loose explanation, but it's the gist of it.  Now, (at 26) I feel better about myself, better self-esteem, a generally stronger person. I have well-defined goals. I have a strong and stable sense of morals and values. I am not a neo-nazi or a corrupt politicain, etc. I believe in human rights and 'live and let live' among other things. I am very anti-violent and anti-hatred. (This is to debunk the myth that atheists are depraved.) Religion has no place in my system. Tough.  Bertrand Russell said that we cannot *know* god doesn't exist, we can't prove it. So, in that sense, we can only truly be agnostic. But, for all practical purposes there is no god.  Thanqs ken engel kene@acs.bu.edu

I know >that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet >hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools, >do you still think that just believing is enough?'  Actually I don't think there is any conflict if we really understand what these passages say.  First, what is faith?  If you study the meaning of the Greek and Hebrew words so translated I think you will come to the conclusion that the word means a *lot* more than mere belief.  Faith means both trust and action.  If you do not put your belief into action it simply cannot qualify as faith.  I think this is what James means when he says that ""faith without works is dead"" and, ""I will show you my faith by my works.""  Remember James was writing to ""the twelve tribes which are scattered abroad.""  This probably means he was writing to those who would hear the gospel much later and wouldn't understand the meaning of the original Greek. (Indeed I suspect James was writing to us, today, among others he intended to reach.)  Paul, on the other hand wrote mostly to the people of the Roman empire who generally understood the meaning of the Greek.  Another key to why there is no conflict is to look at Paul's statements in their context.  I think you will find that when Paul contrasts faith and works it is in the context of comparing the gospel with the Law, meaning the Law of Moses.  This was the great burden of Paul's life.  As the apostle to the Gentiles he would go convert a bunch of people, then the ""Judizers"" would come along and try to convince them that they also had to obey the Law of Moses (cf Acts chapter 15).  In this context Paul condemns the idea of being saved by the works of the Law, saying that we are saved by the blood of Jesus and our faith in him.  I believe that a better translation for today would be that we are saved by *faithfulness*.  I think ""faithfulness"" today has a meaning closer to what the original writers intended.  >Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves >and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.  I think you misunderstand Romans.  What Paul is really saying is that God prefers a faithful Gentile who does not ""keep kosher"" to a kosher Jew who fails to stay faithful in the more important matters of following the Lord and having charity toward his fellows.  >But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to >him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who >knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.  In the sense of faith described above, you cannot have real faith and be lukewarm.  If you know God but are lukewarm (unfaithful), you are worse off than the person who never heard of Him.  Remember, Jesus in the parable of the pearl of great price (Mat 13:45-46) and again in the one on the treasure hidden in the field (Mat 13:44) indicates that the price of the Kingdom of God is *all* we have.  [I agree with you in general, including the fact that ""pistis"" has some of the force of ""faithful"".  However if you take that too far, you can end up with something that Paul definitely would not have intended.  Being faithful means following God in all things.  To say that we are saved by being faithful is very close to saying that we are saved by commiting no sins.  I assume that's not what you meant.  I have almost given up on finding a specific verbal formula that completely captures this.  However I think Paul is describing what I'd call a basic orientation, including aspects such as trust and commitment.  Jesus speaks of it as rebirth, which implies a basic change.  We may still do things that are sinful, and may fail to show the new life in Christ in many situations where we should.  But in any Christian there had better be the basic change in orientation that Jesus calls being born again.  --clh] "

soc.religion.christian	" From: db7n+@andrew.cmu.edu (D. Andrew Byler) Subject: Re: What WAS the immaculate conception Organization: Freshman, Civil Engineering, Carnegie Mellon, Pittsburgh, PA Lines: 48  Biblical basis for the Immaculate Conception:  1) ""I will put enmity between you [the Serpent] and the woman, and between your seed and her seed, she [can also be read he] shall crush your head and you shall bruise her [or his] heel."" -Genesis 3.15  2) ""He who commits sin is of the devil ..."" -1 John 3.8  3) ""Hail, full of grace [greek - kecharitomene], the Lord is with thee ..."" -Luke 1.28  From the above, we prove the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception. First, God has given the proto-evangel in Genesis 3.15, which is the first promise of a savior, who will redeem mankind from the wiles of Satan. ""[Satan] was a murderer from the beginning, and has not stood in the truth because there is no truth in him."" John 8.44.  Now the proto-evangel promises several things, enmity between Satan and ""the woman"", and enmity between Satan and ""her seed.""  Now the woman is both Eve (who is the immediate point of reference) and Mary, the second Eve. ""Her seed"" is Jesus Christ, and He is also at enmity with Satan in the same way as Mary is said to be at enmity with Satan.  Thus, knowing as we do that Jesus Christ is sinless (Hebrews 7.26), we can conclude that Mary is also sinless because if she wasn't she would 1) not be at enmity with the devil, as 1 John 3.8 tells us, and 2) the relation of her sinlessness to Christ's sinlessness would be called into question, as would God's veracity.  For God promised an enmity between Mary and the serpent, and it is not possible for God to lie or be decieved. Second, we have the Angelic Greeting where Mary is called by the Archangle Gabriel ""full of grace.""  As I pointed out above this is from the Greek word ""Kecharitomene"" which means not just full of grace, but a plenitude or perfection of grace.  The sense of it is best grasped by the footnote to the Jerusalem Bible, ""Hail you who have been and reamin filled with grace.""  But that is a little to long to say, so it is reduced to full of grace.  And as it says, ""you who have been"" Mary had always been filled with grace, from the moment of her conception, which was also the moment of her salvation, until her death some years later. It must be admitted that it is possible that God could have done what the doctrine of the Immaclute Conception says He did do.  And if God could keep himself free from any contact with sin, through his Mother, He would have, and the Bible records this fact, to which the Fathers of the Church such as St. John Damascus, St. Augustine of Hippo , St. Ambrose and others are in complete agreement with, as is all of Christian tradition, and as is the infallible declaration of the Pope on the matter in ""Ineffibilus Deus.""

Yes, this is also my understanding of the majority of Islamic laws. However, I believe there are also certain legal rulings which, in all five schools of law (4 sunni and 1 jaffari), can be levelled against muslim or non-muslims, both within and outside dar-al-islam. I do not know if apostasy (when accompanied by active, persistent, and open hostility to Islam) falls into this category of the law. I do know that historically, apostasy has very rarely been punished at all, let alone by the death penalty.  My understanding is that Khomeini's ruling was not based on the law of apostasy (alone). It was well known that Rushdie was an apostate long before he wrote the offending novel and certainly there is no precedent in the Qur'an, hadith, or in Islamic history for indiscriminantly levelling death penalties for apostasy.  I believe the charge levelled against Rushdie was that of ""fasad"". This ruling applies both within and outside the domain of an Islamic state and it can be carried out by individuals. The reward was not offered by Khomeini but by individuals within Iran.   > Stuff deleted > Also, I think you are muddying the issue as you seem to assume that > Khomeini's fatwa was issued due to the _distribution_ of the book.

However, the charge of ""fasad"" can encompass a number of lesser charges. I remember that when diplomatic relations broke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran stressed that the condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from circulation were two preliminary conditions for resolving the ""crisis"". But you are correct to point out that banning the book was not the main thrust behind the fatwa. Islamic charges such as fasad are levelled at people, not books.  The Rushdie situation was followed in Iran for several months before the issuance of the fatwa. Rushdie went on a media blitz, presenting himself as a lone knight guarding the sacred values of secular democracy and mocking the foolish concerns of people crazy enough to actually hold their religious beliefs as sacred. Fanning the flames and milking the controversy to boost his image and push the book, he was everywhere in the media. Then Muslim demonstrators in several countries were killed while protesting against the book. Rushdie appeared momentarily concerned, then climbed back on his media horse to once again attack the Muslims and defend his sacred rights. It was at this point that the fatwa on ""fasad"" was issued.  The fatwa was levelled at the person of Rushdie - any actions of Rushdie that feed the situation contribute to the legitimization of the ruling. The book remains in circulation not by some independant will of its own but by the will of the author and the publishers. The fatwa against the person of Rushdie encompasses his actions as well. The crime was certainly a crime in progress (at many levels) and was being played out (and played up) in the the full view of the media.  P.S. I'm not sure about this but I think the charge of ""shatim"" also applies to Rushdie and may be encompassed under the umbrella of the ""fasad"" ruling. "

I say this because there are many, many instances of Satan described as a being (such as the tormentor in the Old Testament book of Job, or the temptor in the New Testament Gospels).  In the same way, God too is described as a being (or spirit.)  How am I to know one is metaphorical and not the other.  Further, belief in God isn't a bar to evil.  Let's consider the case of Satanists: even if Satan were metaphorical, the Satanist would have to believe in God to justify this belief.  Again, we have a case where someone does believe in God, but by religious standards, they are ""evil.""  If Bobby does see this, let him address this question also.

There are other animals on this planet with advanced mental facilities which have not developed ""religion"" as a satisfactory explaination for the unexplained.  Why is this so?  Further, it appears that only humans have a ""need"" to explain the unexplained.  Why is this so?  The other animals on this planet, including those with advanced mental facilities, seem perfectly content in their ignorance.  I'd like to point out that your presuppositions scream out at me from your unsupported statement.  They are: 1) humans are animal *only*; 2) religion exists as a crutch so that the unexplained need not be researched; 3) religion was ""made up"" by humans to address a perceived need; 4) the biological aspect of humans is deified (that is, all aspects of human life can be categorized in a hierarchical structure with biology at the apex).  Needless to say, I disagree with your strong opinion #1 and the underlying presuppositions.  >Christianity is an infectious cult.

""Oh wow..all i have to do is >follow this christian moral standard and I get eternal happiness."" >For all of you ""found jeezus"" , how many of you were ""on the brink?""  I disagree that Christianity is ""an infectious cult"".  It has certainly shown itself to be persistent as a belief system, in spite of various persecutions throughout the past two millenia. That it continues to persevere does not demonstrate that it is ""infectious"" in a derrogatory sense; it may be that it provides a workable system for its adherents (and I would argue that this is the case).  I disagree that Christianity is ""a safety blanket"" which supplants hope and purpose.  Rather, it points an individual to the one Source of hope and purpose.  There is nothing hidden about a Christian's source for hope and purpose.  Of what usefulness to you is the distinction between internally motivated hope and purpose and externally given hope and purpose?  Is the (apparent) loss of control over one's own life the problem or is it something else?  Finally, one does not appropriate ""eternal happiness"" by following Christian moral standards.  Indeed, the sole reason for the existance of Christianity is *because* standards are inadequate to save people from their imperfections.  Moral standards are merely guides to the Christian; the real power to moral living is given to the Christian in the Person of God's Spirit.  Heaven is one of two final states that Christian doctrine postulates.  However, Christians are generally not motivated to live according to Christian moral standards by this promised future reward; rather, they are motivated by the perceived benefits to them in the here-and-now.  >but i digress...   The other reason christianity flourishes is its >infectious nature.  A best friend of mine breifly entered a christian >group and within months, they set ministry guidelines for him which >basicaly said this -->Priority #1 Spread the Word.  Many Christian organizations are concerned with evangelism as a priority, and rightly so (for it was Jesus Himself who gave this as a priority for His followers).  However, it is not the penultimate priority as evangelism is normally understood (i.e. preach the word, convert at nearly any cost, repeat with new convert ad infinitum). Rather, such evangelism is generally best done through respecting the opinions of others while *demonstrating* the very real benefits of a Christian lifestyle.  This demonstration should be so powerful that it compels the non-Christian to seek out the Christian to ask ""Why?""  Needless to say, such a demonstration is not easily accom- plished (it takes a radical committment to the person of Jesus), it does not happen quickly (so perseverance on the part of the Christian is required), and it cannot occur where no personal bonds of friendship exist (it is ineffective with strangers who cannot evaluate the demonstration over time, and it is easy to alienate or harm others if the sole purpose of being a ""friend"" is to gain a conversion).  As a long-time Christian (nearly 20 years), I view with some skep- ticism *all* evangelism programs which incorporate a ""hurry-up"" attitude.  Pressured conversions may ultimately be worse than no conversion at all (because the pressured convert realizes s/he was coerced and disavows Christianity when they would have been open to it in the future had they not been taken advantage of now). The Bible states that it is the very Spirit of God which brings conviction of wrong-doing to people.  I am content to do my part (witness) and let the Spirit do the rest.  >We are _just_ animals.

(For reflection, what animals have the wide variety of performing arts that humans do?  How is it that humans can learn the language of other humans (or animals) but that other animals cannot do so? How is it that humans can organize themselves in various social structures whereas other animals have only one structure?)  >Religion (especially Christianity) is nothing more than a DRUG.

I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from 2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue their development.  The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now. Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad?  They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads (unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention.

I think of it as ""Don't worry, be happy"".  For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?  There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses word ""on faith"", we just mean that having found this person to be reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now. If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about gods?  The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing, rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?  I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until contrary evidence is found.  David Nye (nyeda@cnsvax.uwec.edu).

First of all, the original poster misquoted.  The reference is from 2 Tim 3:16. The author was Paul, and his revelations were anything but ""(at best) second-hand"".  ""And is came about that as [Saul] journeyed, he was approaching Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him; and he fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to him, ""Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?""  And he said, ""Who art Thou, Lord?""  And He said, ""I am Jesus whom you are persecuting, . . ."" (Acts 9:3-5, NAS)  Paul received revelation directly from the risen Jesus!  (Pretty cool, eh?)  He became closely involved with the early church, the leaders of which were followers of Jesus throughout his ministry on earth.  >Now, you may say, ""The Holy Spirit revealed these things >     unto him,"" and we could go into that argument, but >     you'd be hard-pressed to convince me that the Holy >     Spirit exists.  I agree.  I don't believe anyone but the Spirit would be able to convince you the Spirit exists.  Please don't complain about this being circular.  I know it is, but really, can anything of the natural world explain the supernatural? (This is why revelation is necessary to the authors of the Bible.)  >     Additionally, what he has written is >     again second-hand info if it were given by the Spirit, >     and still carries the chance it is not true.  The Spirit is part of God.  How much closer to the source can you get? The Greek in 2 Timothy which is sometimes translated as ""inspired by God"", literally means ""God-breathed"".  In other words, God spoke the actual words into the scriptures.  Many theologians and Bible scholars (Dr. James Boice is one that I can remember off-hand) get quite annoyed by the dryness and incompleteness of ""inspired by God"".  >The only way you would be able to escape this notion of >     ""second-hand"" info is to have had the entire Bible >     written by God himself.  And to tell the truth, I've >     studied the Bible extensively, and have yet to >     hear of scholars who have put forth objective evidence >     showing God as the first author of this collection of >     books.  That's what the verse taken from 2 Timothy was all about.  The continuity of a book written over a span of 1500 years by more than 40 authors from all walks of life is a testimony to the single authorship of God.  >> And as for reason, read what it says in 1 Corinthians 1:18-31 about >> human wisdom.

If there is no God, which seems to be your current belief, then Jesus was either a liar or a complete nut because not only did he assert that God exists, but he claimed to be God himself!  (regards to C.S. Lewis)  How then could you have the least bit of respect for Jesus? In conclusion, be careful about logically unfounded hypotheses based on gut feelings about the text and other scholars' unsubstantiated claims. The Bible pleads that we take it in its entirety or throw the whole book out. About your reading of the Bible, not only does the Spirit inspire the writers, but he guides the reader as well.  We cannot understand it in the least without the Spirit's guidance:  ""For to us God revealed them through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.""

I agree that there is truth in scripture.  There are principles to be learned from it.  Claiming that that truth is absolute, though, seems to imply a literal reading of the Bible.  If it were absolute truth (constant across time, culture, etc.) then no interpretation would be necessary.  It may be that the lessons gleaned from various passages are different from person to person.  To me, that doesn't mean that one person is right and the other is wrong.  I believe that God transcends our simple minds, and that scripture may very well have been crafted with exactly this intent.  God knows me, and knows that my needs are different from yours or anyone else's.  By claiming that scripture is absolute, then at least one person in every disputed interpretation must be wrong. I just don't believe that God is that rigid.  > >Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture > >to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.) > >Can you reconcile this? > > Sure.  The Bible preaches absolute truths.  However, exactly what those > truths are is sometimes a matter of confusion.  As I said, the Bible does > preach absolute truths.  Sometimes those fundamental principles are crystal > clear (at least to evangelicals).  This is where the arrogance comes in to play.  Since these principles are crystal clear to evangelicals, maybe the rest of us should just take their word for it?  Maybe it isn't at all crystal clear to *me* that their fundamental principles are either fundamental *or* principles.  I think we've established that figuring out Biblical truth is a matter of human interpretation and therefore error-prone.  Yet you can still claim that some of them may be crystal clear?  Maybe to a certain segment of Christianity, but to all.  > >It's very difficult to see how you can claim something which is based > >on your own *interpretation* is absolute. > > God revealed his Truths to the world, through His Word.

Practically anything can be misinterpreted, especially > when it comes to matters of right and wrong.  Care to deny that?  Not at all.  I think it supports my position much more effectively than yours.  :-)  So, I think that your position is: The Bible is absolute truth, but as we are prone to error in our interpretation, we cannot reliably determine if we have figured out what that truth is. Did I get that right?  What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we can never (or at least shouldn't) act upon them?  What practical difference can this make?  Carol Alvin caralv@auto-trol.com

The publication was enormously successful: we distributed 2000 copies to space enthusiasts across the country and even sent a few to people in Great Britain, Australia, and Ecuador. Due to the tremendous response to the first edition, PPS has published an expanded, up-to-date second edition of the guide.  The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of ""Space Jobs"" features strategies for entering the space field and describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an astronaut and listings of NASA Space Grant Fellowships and Consortia, as well as NASA Centers for the Commercial Development of Space.

Bussard, Journal of Propulsion and Power, Vol. 6, No. 5, Sept.-Oct. 1990  Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust"" interplanetary flight is not possible, because system acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100 times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a 53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with 19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in Earth/moon space.

[This is an introduction to the application of Bussard's version of the Farnsworth/Hirsch electrostatic confinement fusion technology to propulsion. 1500<Isp<5000 sec. Farnsworth/Hirsch demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in 1969 but it was dropped when panic ensued over the surprising stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim Bowery]  ""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.  Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]  ION DRIVES:  Retrieve files pub/SPACE/SPACELINK/6.5.2.* from the Ames SPACE archive; these deal with many aspects of ion drives and describe the SERT I and II missions, which flight-tested cesium ion thrusters in the 1960s and 70s.

Like I said, the Prince of Tyre was the human ruler of Tyre.  He was a wicked man.  By calling Satan the King of Tyre, Ezekiel was saying that Satan is the real ruler over Tyre.

At the cost of repudiating the FAQ, I think too much is made of the strong vs weak atheism issue, although in the context of alt.atheism, where we're continually attacked on the basis that strong atheists ""believe"" in the non-existence of god, I think the separation is a valid one.  To cover my arse, what I'm trying to say is that there is an infinitely grey area between weak and strong, as well as between strong and the unattainable mathematical atheism (I wish!).  Whereas I _logically_ can only support the weak atheist position, in effect I am a strong atheist (and wish I could be a mathematical one).  To justify my strong atheist position I believe I need only show that the evidence presented in favour of any of the gods under scrutiny is faulty.  If I read the FAQ correctly, no argument for the existence of god (generic, as represented by mainstream theologians) has ever been found to be unassailable.  To me this is adequate evidence that the _real_god_ is undefinable (or at least no definition has yet been found to be watertight), which in turn I accept as sufficient to base a disbelief in each and every conceivable god.

The Book of Esther (which I read the other day for other reasons) describes the origin of Pur'im, a Jewish celbration of joy and peace.  The long and short of the story is that 75,000 people were killed when people were tripping over all of the peacefull solutions lying about (you couldn't swing a sacred cow without slammin into a nice, peaceful solution.)  'Course Joshua and the jawbone of an ass spring to mind...  I agree with Bobby this far: religion as it is used to kill large numbers of people is usually not used in the form or manner that it was originally intended for.  That doesn't reduce the number of deaths directly caused by religion, it is just a minor observation of the fact that there is almost nothing pure in the Universe.  The very act of honestly attempting to find true meaning in religious teaching has many times inspired hatred and led to war.  Many people have been led by religious leaders more involved in their own stomache-contentsthan in any absolute truth, and have therefore been driven to kill by their leaders.  The point is that there are many things involved in religion that often lead to war.  Whether these things are a part of religion, an unpleasant side effect or (as Bobby would have it) the result of people switching between Religion and Atheism spontaneously, the results are the same.  @Religious groups have long been involved in the majority of the bloodiest parts of Man's history.@  Atheists, on the other hand (preen,preen) are typically not an ideological social caste, nor are they driven to organize and spread their beliefs. The overuse of Nazism and Stalinism just show how true this is:  Two groups with very clear and specific ideologies using religious persecution to further their means.  Anyone who cannot see the obvious - namely that these were groups founded for reasons *entirely* their own, who used religious persecution not because of any belief system but because it made them more powerfull - is trying too hard.  Basically, Bobby uses these examples because there are so few wars that were *not* *specifically* fought over religion that he does not have many choices.

Wait a minute, Doug.  I know you are better informed than that.  The US has never invaded Nicaragua (as far as I know).  We liberated Grenada from the Cubans	to protect US citizens there and to prevent the completion of a strategic air strip.  Panama we invaded, true (twice this century). Vietnam?  We were invited in by the government of S. Vietnam.  (I guess we ""invaded"" Saudi Arabia during the Gulf War, eh?)  Mexico?  We have invaded Mexico 2 or 3 times, once this century, but there were no missiles for anyone to shoot over here at that time.  Hawaii?  We liberated it from Spain.  So if you mean by the word ""invaded"" some sort of military action where we cross someone's border, you are right 5 out of 6.  But normally ""invaded"" carries a connotation of attacking an autonomous nation. (If some nation ""invades"" the U.S. Virgin Islands, would they be invading the Virgin Islands or the U.S.?)  So from this point of view, your score falls to 2 out of 6 (Mexico, Panama).  [...] > > What's a ""peace-nik""?  Is that somebody who *doesn't* masturbate > over ""Guns'n'Ammo"" or what?

And one who would allow Hitler to wipe all *all* Jews, slavs, and political dissidents in areas he controlled as long as he left the rest of us alone.  ""Is it supposed to be bad to be a peace-nik,"" you ask?  Well, it depends on what your values are.  If you value life over liberty, peace over freedom, then I guess not.  But if liberty and freedom mean more to you than life itself; if you'd rather die fighting for liberty than live under a tyrant's heel, then yes, it's ""bad"" to be a peace-nik.  The problem with most peace-niks it they consider those of us who are not like them to be ""bad"" and ""unconscionable"".  I would not have any argument or problem with a peace-nik if they held to their ideals and stayed out of all conflicts or issues, especially those dealing with the national defense.  But no, they are not willing to allow us to legitimately hold a different point-of-view.  They militate and many times resort to violence all in the name of peace.  (What rank hypocrisy!)

A simple example:  In the New Testament (sorry I don't have a Bible at work, and can't provide a reference), women are instructed to be silent and cover their heads in church.  Now, this is scripture.  By your definition, this is truth and therefore absolute.  Do women in your church speak?  Do they cover their heads?  If all scripture is absolute truth, it seems to me that women speaking in and coming to church with bare heads should be intolerable to evangelicals. Yet, clearly, women do speak in evangelical churches and come with bare heads.  (At least this was the case in the evangelical churches I grew up in.)  Evangelicals are clearly not taking this particular part of scripture to be absolute truth.  (And there are plenty of other examples.)

The latter was written with simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).  More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32 projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.  You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland, ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.  You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS: Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.  A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos, (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.  A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:  R. Miller and F. Reddy, ""Mapping the World in Pascal"", Byte V12 #14, December 1987  Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.  Some references for spherical trignometry are:  _Spherical Astronomy_, W.M.

The Bible ""ends"" with the book of Revelations. But does God's reign end there ? No. So who can say for sure that God's messages are either no longer happening or still happening ?  I can now hear the clamor for proof. 8-) With the cold response I've gotten from the past from this group, it's very hard to get the point across. I'll only go over the physical stuff so that skeptics can look at documents stored somewhere. I've cited the uncorrupted bodies of saints before. They're still there. 8-) The apparitions at Fatima, Portugal culminated in a miracle specifically granted to show God's existence. That was the spinning/descending of the sun. It was seen in several countries. That event is ""approved"" by the Pope. Currently, images of Mary in Japan, Korea, Yugoslavia, Philippines, Africa are showing tears (natural or blood). These are still under investigation by the Church. But realize that investigations take decades to finish. And if the message is Christ will come in ten days, that's a bit too late, isn't it 8-). Other events under investigation are inner locutions (""coming to know""), stigmata (the person exhibits Christ's wounds. And they don't heal. And doctor's don't know why). Non-believers are welcome to pore through documents, I'm sure.  This stuff is not like Koresh. Or Oral Roberts (give me $5M or God will call me home). It's free. Find out why they're happening (as we ourselves are studying why). If anybody can figure this out, tell us ! You can be of any religion. If you have the resources, go to one of the countries I mentioned. These are not ""members only"" events. God and Mary invites everybody.  So in conclusion (finally) ... We RC's believe in the modern day manifestations of God and Mary. We are scared to death sometimes although we're told not to. There are more proofs and events. And that is why ""not everything is in the Bible"". Although in a lot of the apparitions, we are told to read the Bible.  As far as the Protestant vs. Catholics issue is concerned... In the end, God's churches will unite. I'm not sure how. I have some idea. But the point is we shouldn't worry about the ""versus"" part. Just do God's work. That's all that matters. Unity will come.  BTW, I'm just a plain person. I'm not the Pope's spokesperson. But I am RC.  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mark Ashley                        |DISCLAIMER: My opinions.

I suspect that these books will extrapolate an awful lot on the quotes they have.  At least one poster on the Islam channel seems to have some misgivings about the practice of using the Koran to decide what is good science.  I wonder if Islam has ever come up with the equivalent of the Christians ""Creation Science"" on any topic.  It would be interesting to find a history of scientific interpretations of the Koran, to see if anyone used the Koran to support earlier science which has since been discarded.  It is all too easy to look at science as it exists today and then ""interpret"" passages to match those findings.  People do similar things with the sayings of Nostradamus all the time.  Anyway, it is a rather unique claim of Islam and may be worth checking.   "

soc.religion.christian	" From: gideon@otago.ac.nz (Gideon King) Subject: Should Christians fight? / Justifiable war Organization: University of Otago Lines: 144  I posted this a couple of weeks ago, and it doesn't seem to have appeared on the newsgroup, and I haven't had a reply from the moderator. We were having intermittent problems with our mail at the time. Please excuse me if you have seen this before...  Should Christians fight?  Last week Alastair posted some questions about fighting, and whether there are such things as ""justifiable wars"". I have started looking into these things and have jotted down my findings as I go. I haven't answered all his questions yet, and I know what I have here is on a slightly different tack, but possibly I'll be able to get into it more deeply later, and post some more info soon.  Our duty to our neighbour:  Do good to all men (Gal 6:10) Love our neighbour as ourselves (Matt 22:39)  Act the part of the good Samaritan (Luke 10) toward any who may be in trouble. We will therefore render every possible assistance to an injured man, and therefore should not be part of any organisation which causes people harm (even medical corps of the army etc).  Christians are by faith ""citizens of the commonwealth of Israel"" (Ephesians 2:11-12), and also recognise that ""God rules in the kingdoms of men"", and therefore we should not be taking part in any of the struggles of those nations which we are not part of due to our faith.  We are to be ""strangers and pilgrims"" amongst the nations, so we are just passing through, and not part of any nation or any national aspirations (this can also be applied to politics etc, but that's another story). We are not supposed to ""strive"" or ""resist evil"" (even ""suffer yourselves to be defrauded"") it is therefore incosistent for us to strive to assist in preserving a state which Christ will destroy when he returns to set up God's kingdom.  Our duty to the state.  ""Render therefore unto Caesar the things which be Caesar's and unto God the things which be God's"" (Luke 20:25). ""Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God; the powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God"" (Rom 13:1-2). ""Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake; whether it be to king as supreme... for so is the will of God that with well doing ye may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men"" (1 Pet 2:13-15)  These scriptures make it clear that submission to the powers that be is a divine command, but it is equally clear from Acts 5:19-29 that when any ordinance of man runs counter to God's law, we must refuse submission to it. The reason for this is that we are God's ""bond servants"" and His service is our life's task. An example of the type of thing is in Col 3:22-23 where bondservants were to ""work heartily as unto the Lord"" - so also we should work as if our boss was God - i.e. ""Pressed down, shaken together, and running over""... oops - a bit of a side track there...  In the contests between the nations, we are on God's side - a side that is not fighting in the battle, but is ""testifying"" to the truth.  When we believe in God and embrace His promises, we become ""fellow citizens with the Saints and of the Household of God"", and are no longer interested in associations of the world. Think of this in relation to unions etc as well. Paul tells us to ""lay aside every weight"" that we may run ""the race that is set before us"", and if we are wise, we will discard any association which would retard our progress - ""Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life, that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier"" (2 Tim 2:3-4).  One of these entanglements he warns about is ""be ye not unequally yoked together with unbelievers"". One of the obvious applications of this is marriage with unbelievers, but it also covers things like business partnerships and any other position where we may form a close association with any person or persons not believing the truth about God (in this case the army). The principle comes from Deut 22:10 - remember that as well as them being different animals of different strengths, one was clean and one unclean under the law. These ideas are strongly stressed in 2 Cor 6:13-18 - I suggest you read this. The yoking also has another aspect - that of servitude, and Jesus says ""take my yoke upon you"", so we are then yoked with Christ and cannot be yoked with unbelievers. We have already seen that we are bondservants of Christ, and Paul says ""become not ye the bondservants of men (1 Cor 7:23 RV).  An example from the Old Testament: the question is asked in 2 Chr 19:2 ""Shouldest thou help the ungodly...?"". The situation here is a good example of what happens when you are yoked together with unbelievers. Jehoshaphat was lucky to escape with his life. Here are the facts: 1. He had made an affinity with Ahab, who had ""sold himself to work wickedness before the Lord"" (1 Kings 21:25). 2. When asked by Ahab to form a military alliance, he had agreed and said ""I am as thou art, my people as thy people"" (1 Kings 22:4) - an unequal yoking. 3. He sttod firm in refusing the advice of the false prophets and insisted on hearing the prophet of the Lord (trying to do the right thing), he found that he was yoked and therefore couldn't break away from the evil association he had made.  God says to us ""Come out from among them and be ye separate, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you and ye shall be my sons and daughters"" (2 Cor 6:17).  This is more or less what I have found out so far - I'm still looking into it, as I don't think I've answered all the questions raised by Alastair yet. Heres a summary and a few things to think about:  The Christian in under command. Obedience to this command is an essential factor in his relationship with Christ (John 15:10,14).  Total dedication to this course of action is required (Romans 12:1-2).  Disobedience compromises the close relationship between Christ and his followers (1 Pet 2:7-8).  We are to be separated to God (Rom 6:4). This involves a master-servant relationship (Rom 6:12,16).  No man can serve two masters (Matt 6:24,13,14).  All that is in the 'Kosmos' is lust and pride - quite opposed to Gos (1 John 2:16). Christs kingdom is not of this world (i.e. not worldly in nature) - if it was, his servants would fight to deliver him. If Christ is our master and he was not delivered by his servants because his kingdom was not of this world, then his servants cannot possibly fight for another master.  Strangers and pilgrims have no rights, and we cannot swear allegiance to anyone but God.  The servant of the Lord must not war but be gentle to all (2 Tim 2:24) - this does not just apply to war, but also to avoiding strife throughout our lives. There is a war to be waged, not with man's weapons (2 Cor 10:3-4), but with God's armour (Eph6:13-20).  I'll probably post some more when I've had time to look into things a bit further.  -- Gideon King                         | Phone +64-3-479 8347 University of Otago                 | Fax   +64-3-479 8529 Department of Computer Science      | e-mail gideon@farli.otago.ac.nz P.O.

Yes, and he was writing and speaking for an audience that was at best, very weak in the faith; most could not read, most were unfamiliar with the Hebrew Scriptures in even the Septuagint form.

Are you Christian or Pauline?  [Both.  There is no doubt in my mind about what is sin and what is not, at least not in this case.  Jesus did not deal explicitly with the question of whether the Law was binding on Gentiles.  That's why I have to cite evidence such as the way Jesus dealt with the Centurion.  As to general Jewish views on this, I am dependent largely on studies of Pauline theology, one by H.J. Schoeps, and one whose author I can't come up with at the moment.  Both authors are Jews.  Also, various Christian and non-Christian Jews have discussed the issue here and in other newsgroups.  Mat 5:19 is clear that the Law is still valid.  It does not say that it applies to Gentiles.  And yes, I say that the specific requirement for worship on the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments is a ceremonial detail, when you're looking at the obligations of Gentiles.  Similarly circumcision.  I'm not sure quite what else I can say on this subject.  Again, it's unfortunate the Jesus didn't answer the question directly.  However we do know (1) what the 1st Cent. Jewish approach was, (2) how Jesus dealt with at least one Gentile, and (3) how Jesus' disciples dealt with the issue when it became more acute (I'm referring to Acts 15 more than Paul).  Given that these are all in agreement, I don't see that there's a big problem.  --clh] "

All of which require something we Christians readily admit to: ``Faith''.  The fact that there are several candidates belies that *none* are conclusive. With out conclusive evidence, we are left with faith.  It could even be argued that one of these hypotheses may one day be proven (as best as a non-repeatable event can be ""proven"").  But I ask, what holds someone *today* to the belief that any or all of them are correct, except by faith?  [ a couple of paragraphs deleted.

Hence, we *have* religions.  = The question ""why anything exists"" can be countered by = demanding answer to a question ""why there is nothing in nothingness, = or in non-existence"".  Actually, both questions turn out to be = devoid of meaning. Things that exist do, and things that don't exist = don't exist. Tautology at its best.  Carefully examine the original question, and then the ""counter-question"". The first asks ""Why"", while the second is a request for definition.  It doesn't address why something does or does not exist, but asks to define the lack of existence.  The second question is unanswerable indeed, for how do we identify something as ""nothing"" (aren't they mutually exclusive terms)?.  How do we identify a state of non-existence (again, this is nearing the limits of this simple layman's ability to comprehend, and I would appreciate an explanation).  I might add, the worldview of ""Things that exist do, and things that don't...don't"" is as grounded in the realm of the non-falsifiable, as does the theist's belief in God.  It is based on the assumption that there is *not* a reason for being, something as ultimately (un)supportable as the position of there being a reason.  Its very foundation exists in the same soil as that of one who claims there *is* a reason.  We come to this. Either ""I am, therefore I am."", or ""I am for a reason."" If the former is a satisfactory answer, then you are done, for you are satisfied, and need not a doctor.  If the latter, your search is just beginning.  = I seriously doubt God could have an answer to this question.  Time will tell. 8^)  = = Some Christians I have talked to have said that actually, God is = Himself the existence. However, I see several problems with this = answer. First, it inevitably leads to the conclusion that God is = actually _all_ existence, good and evil, devils and angels, us and = them. This is pantheism, not Christianity.  Agreed.  It would lead me to question their definition of Christianity as well.  = Another answer is that God is the _source_ of all existence. = This sounds much better, but I am tempted to ask: Does God = Himself exist, then? If God is the source of His own existence, = it can only mean that He has, in terms of human time, always = existed. But this is not the same as the source of all existence.  This does not preclude His existence.  It only seeks to identify His *qualities* (implying He exists to *have* qualities, BTW).  = The best answer I have heard is that human reasoning is incapable = of understanding such questions. Being an atheist myself, I do not = accept such answers, since I do not have any other methods.  Like the theist, we come to a statement of faith, for this position assumes that the evidence at hand is conclusive.  Note, I am not arguing against scientific endeavor, for science is useful for understanding the universe in which we exist. But I differ from the atheist in a matter of perspective.  I seek to understand what exists to understand and appreciate the art of the Creator.  I also have discovered science is an inadequate tool to answer ""why"".   It appears that M. Pihko agrees (as we shall see).  But because a tool is inadequate to answer a question does not preclude the question.  Asserting that 'why' is an invalid question does not provide an answer.  = : As far as I can tell, the very laws of nature demand a ""why"".  That isn't = : true of something outside of nature (i.e., *super*natural). = = This is not true. Science is a collection of models telling us ""how"", = not why, something happens. I cannot see any good reason why the ""why"" = questions would be bound only to natural things, assuming that the = supernatural domain exists.

Why did pre-existence become existence.  Why did pre-spacetime become spacetime.  But we come to the admission that science fails to answer ""Why?"".  Because it can't be answered in the realm of modern science, does that make the question invalid? = : I don't believe *any* = : technology would be able to produce that necessary *spark* of life, despite = : having all of the parts available.

I suppose we would do the same thing as when Galileo or Capernicus was *vindicated*  (before someone starts jumping up and down screaming ""Inquisition!"", note I said *vindicated*.  I certainly hope we've gotten beyond the ""shooting the messenger"" stage).  M. Pihko does present a good point though.  We may need to ask ""What do I as an individual Christian base my faith on?""  Will it be shaken by the production of evidence that shatters our ""sacred cows"" or will we seek to understand if a new discovery truly disagrees with what God *said* (and continues to say) in his Word?

That is not quite accurate.  Otherwise we would have the book of Enoch in the canon (as Dave noted).  One can say that the apocrypha are not quoted by Christ.  Dave also writes:  III. The deuterocanonicals are not in the canon because they teach doctrines contrary to the (uncontroverted) parts of the canon.  then I answer: These is a logically invalid *a priori*. Besides, we are talking about OT texts- which in many parts are superceded by the NT (in the Xtian view). Would not this same principle exclude _Ecclesiastes_? This principle cannot be consistently applied.  I have to reject your argument here.  The Spirit speaks with one voice, and he does not contradict himself.  The ultimate test of canonicity is whether the words are inspired by the Spirit, i.e., God-breathed.  It is a test which is more guided by faith than by reason or logic.  The early church decided that the Apocrypha did not meet this test--even though some books such as The Wisdom of Ben Sirach have their uses.  For example, the Lutheran hymn ""Now Thank We All Our God"" quotes a passage from this book.  The deutero-canonical books were added much later in the church's history.  They do not have the same spiritual quality as the rest of Scripture.  I do not believe the church that added these books was guided by the Spirit in so doing.  And that is where this sort of discussion ultimately ends.  David H.

This is >an issue that may be very personal, but is important.  What does >the Bible say about this and how can we encourage our friends with >regard to this issue?  This brings up an interesting subject that has not been discussed much, and probably has not been studied much.  As some of you may be aware, I've posted a lot of articles lately on personality typing (of which the MBTI is a test vehicle).  To come up to speed, just read 'alt.psychology.personality' and/or ask for by personality type summary file.  One observation is that people have significantly different personalities (no question on this) which seem to be essentially in-born.  With respect to church attendance and participation, some people thrive on this, while other people have real difficulty with this because they prefer a more solitary and contemplative lifestyle - that is, they are de-energized if confronted with excessive closeness to outside activities and lots of people.  Of course this is measured by extroversion/introversion.  My impression is that many churches are totally blind to this fact, and create environments that 'scare away' many who are naturally introverted (there are many introverted characters in the Bible, btw).  I know, I am quite introverted in preference, and find the 'pressure' by many churches to participate, to meet together in large groups, etc., to be very uncomfortable.  Knowing what I know now, these churches have been overly influenced by highly extroverted people who thrive on this sort of thing. (BTW, there's nothing wrong with either extroversion or introversion, both preferences have their place in the Body).  Maybe I should define extrovert/introvert more carefully since these words are usually not used correctly in our culture.  The extrovert/introvert scale is a measure of how a person is energized.  The following is excerpted from my summary:  1.  Energizing - How a person is energized:  Extroversion (E)- Preference for drawing energy from the outside world of people, activities or things.  Introversion (I)- Preference for drawing energy from one's internal world of ideas, emotions, or impressions.   Hopefully this will elicit further discussion as to how churches can structure themselves to meet the real needs of the people who comprise the Body of Christ, instead of trying to change people's personalities to fit them into a particular framework.  I'm sure there are other aspects of how churches have not properly understood personality variances among their members to the detriment of all.  Jon Noring  --  Charter Member --->>>  INFJ Club.

In other words, I think that statements like gods are or somehow interfere with this world are false or meaningless. In Ontology, one can fairly conclude that when ""A exist"" is meaningless A does not exist. Under the Pragmatic definition of truth, ""A exists"" is meaningless makes A exist even logically false.  A problem with such statements is that one can't disprove a subjective god by definition, and there might be cases where a subjective god would even make sense. The trouble with most god definitions is that they include some form of objective existence with the consequence of the gods affecting all. Believers derive from it a right to interfere with the life of others.

Most of the accusations and fabrications about Shi'ites come out of Saudi Arabia from the Wahabis. For that matter you should read the original works of the Sunni Imams (Imams of the four madhabs). The teacher of at least two of them was Imam Jafar Sadiq (the sixth Imam of the Shi'ites).  Although there is plenty of false propaganda floating around about the Shi'ites (esp. since the revolution), there are also many good works by Shi'ites which present the views and teachings of their school.

I find this argument very strange, though not unfamiliar.  An analogy someone used a while back can perhaps illustrate it.  Say, for example, there are people living on a volcanic island, and a group of geologists determine that a volcano is imminent. They warn the people on the island that they are in danger, and should leave. A group of people on the island is given the task of warning others of the danger.  They believe the danger is real, but others may not.  Does that mean that the first group are NECESSARILY arrogant in warning others of the danger? Does it mean that they are saying that their beliefs are correct, and all others are false?  Some might indeed react to opposition with arrogance, and behave in an arrogant manner, but that is a personal idiocyncracy. It does not necessarily mean that they are all arrogant.   ============================================================ Steve Hayes, Department of Missiology & Editorial Department Univ. of South Africa, P.O.

Look for subject lines starting with ""Alt.Atheism FAQ:"".  2. Check the newsgroup news.answers for the same subject lines.  If you don't find anything in steps 1 or 2, your news system isn't set up correctly, and you may wish to tell your system administrator about the problem.  3. If you have anonymous FTP access, connect to rtfm.mit.edu [18.172.1.27]. Go to the directory /pub/usenet/alt.atheism, and you'll find the latest versions of the FAQ files there.  FTP is a a way of copying files between networked computers.  If you need help in using or getting started with FTP, send e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with  send usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq  in the body.  4. There are other sites which also carry news.answers postings.  The article ""Introduction to the news.answers newsgroup"" carries a list of these sites; the article is posted regularly to news.answers.  5. If you don't have FTP, send mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu consisting of the following lines:  send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources send usenet/alt.atheism/faq send usenet/alt.atheism/introduction send usenet/alt.atheism/logic send usenet/alt.atheism/resources  5. (Penultimate resort)  Send mail to mail-server@mantis.co.uk consisting of the following lines:  send atheism/faq/faq.txt send atheism/faq/logic.txt send atheism/faq/intro.txt send atheism/faq/resource.txt  and our poor overworked modems will try and send you a copy of the files. There's other stuff, too; interesting commands to try are ""help"" and ""send atheism/index"".  6. (Last resort)  Mail mathew@mantis.co.uk, or post an article to the newsgroup asking how you can get the FAQ files.  You should only do this if you've tried the above methods and they've failed; it's not nice to clutter the newsgroup or people's mailboxes with requests for files. it's better than posting without reading the FAQ, though!  For instance, people whose email addresses get mangled in transit and who don't have FTP will probably need assistance obtaining the FAQ files.   mathew  "

Khomeini put a price on the head of someone in another country, this makes him a jerk as well as an international outlaw. Khomeini advocates the view that there was a series of twelve Islamic leaders (the Twelve Imams) who are free of error or sin. This makes him a heretic. In the Qur'an Muhammad is chastised for error directly by God; the Qur'an says that Muhammad is the greatest example of proper Islamic behavior; thus no muslim is free from error.   >As usual there seems to be almost as many Islamic viewpoints as there >are Muslims.  Perhaps it seems so to you, but this is hardly the case. There is widespread agreement about matters of Islam. There certainly are many viewpoints on issues which are not particularly Islamic in and of themselves, but this is so for any large group of people under the same name.  >It all comes back to the Koran being so imprecise in its wording.  The Qur'an is not particularly imprecise in wording, though it is true that several interpretations are possible in the interpretations of many words. However, as an entire text the Qur'an makes its meanings precise enough for intelligent people free from power lust to come to agreement about them.    Gregg "

sci.space	" From: baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov (Ron Baalke) Subject: SIRTF Mission is Still Alive Organization: Jet Propulsion Laboratory Lines: 114 Distribution: world NNTP-Posting-Host: kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov Keywords: SIRTF, JPL News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41  From the ""JPL Universe"" April 23, 1993  SIRTF is still very much in business  By Mark Whalen In these times of extra-tight NASA budgets, the very survival of a number of missions has been uncertain. But thanks to major design refinements implemented in recent months, JPL's Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) -- a major project considered to be in trouble a couple of years ago -- is ""alive and well,"" according to Project Scientist Michael Werner. A lighter spacecraft, revised orbit and shorter mission have added up to a less expensive project with ""tremendous scientific power"" and a bright future, said Werner. Designed as a follow-up to the highly successful Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) and Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) missions, SIRTF -- a cryogenically cooled observatory for infrared astronomy from space -- is scheduled for launch in 2000 or 2001 if plans proceed as scheduled. IRAS' pioneering work in space-based infrared astronomy 10 years ago allowed astronomers to view the Milky Way as never before and revealed, among other things, 60,000 galaxies and 25 comets. It provided a sky survey 1,000 times more sensitive than any previously available from ground-based observations. COBE has measured the infrared and microwave background radiation on large angular scales, and revealed new facts about the early universe. But to illuminate SIRTF's potential, Jim Evans, JPL's manager of Astrophysics and Fundamental Physics Pre-Projects, recently said that the project is ""1,000 to 1 million times more capable than IRAS,"" based on technological advances in infrared detector arrays. However, despite the enormous strides in infrared exploration SIRTF promised, and the fact that it was cited as the highest priority new initiative for all of astronomy in the 1990s (by the National Academy of Sciences), it took a ""diet or die"" directive from NASA Headquarters last year to keep the project going, according to Werner. The project is now known as Atlas SIRTF, based on the key factor in its new design: The satellite will orbit the sun instead of the Earth, permitting the use of an Atlas rocket launch instead of the formerly proposed and heavier Titan. ""The main advantage of the solar orbit is that you can use all of your launch capability for boosting the payload -- you don't have to carry up a second rocket to circularize the orbit,"" Werner said. The other advantage to a solar orbit, he said, is that ""it's in a better thermal environment, away from the heat of the Earth."" Additional major changes in SIRTF's redesign include shortening the mission from five to three years and building a spacecraft that is less than half as heavy as in the original plan -- Atlas SIRTF will weigh 2,470 kilograms (5,400 pounds) compared to Titan SIRTF's 5,500 kilograms (12,100 pounds). All of that adds up to ""a less stressful launch environment,"" Werner said, and a cost savings of more than $200 million for the launch, in addition to increased savings in the design of the smaller, less massive spacecraft. Werner said SIRTF's redesign came as a result of Congress' telling NASA ""you're trying to do too many things. If you want us to support SIRTF, which is a good project, develop a plan to see how it fits into (NASA's) overall strategy."" Shortly thereafter, SIRTF was named as NASA's highest priority ""flagship"" scientific mission by the interdisciplinary Space Sciences Advisory Committee, in addition to the blessing from the National Academy of Sciences. While the spacecraft and its instruments required descoping to keep the project alive, SIRTF's major scientific contribution always promised to come about from its advanced infrared detector arrays, which will allow images to be developed ""tens of thousands of times faster"" than before, according to Evans. ""Up until a couple of years ago,"" Werner said, ""all infrared astronomy was done with single detectors -- or very small arrays of individually assembled detectors. Since then, the Department of Defense has developed a program to produce arrays of tens or hundreds of thousands of detectors, rather than just a few, and those are very well suited for use on SIRTF."" Werner noted that in addition to dealing with budget pressures, Congress is currently watching NASA projects with an eye out for any ""technological spinoff."" ""On that question, I think we have some things to say,"" he said, ""because the detectors we're using are straight off various military developments. Also, SIRTF will be built by the U.S. aerospace industry, and it's a real technological and engineering challenge in addition to being a tremendous scientific project. ""SIRTF will be used by the entire astronomical community,"" Werner added, but the revised three-year mission ""puts a premium on observing time. We have to educate the user community and develop a program that involves early surveys and quick turnaround of the data."" Werner said the downsizing of the project required a reduction in scope and complexity of SIRTF's three instruments -- the infrared spectrograph, infrared array camera and multiband imaging photometer. However, these reductions will only result in losses of efficiency rather than capability, he said. The project hopes to start a ""Phase B"" activity in 1995, which will provide a detailed concept for development and design. Building the hardware would begin about two years later. Projected cost estimates, Evans said, are $850 million-$950 million. ""I am very optimistic about SIRTF,"" he said. ""It will provide a tremendous return for the investment."" Werner added that an additional benefit from the project will be the ""enrichment of our intellectual and cultural environment. People on the street are very interested in astronomy ... black holes, the possibility of life on other planets, the origin of the universe ... and those are the kind of questions SIRTF will help answer."" ### ___    _____     ___ /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

Of course if this question was asked in a group dealing with economics, the answer would be that the cause of war was economic. My observations over the past 30 years (and not withstanding a little history reading beside) is that while religious differences do play a part in many of the conflicts, so does (unfortunately) race, economics and any other items that identify one group of men as being different from another.  If we want to couch the cause of conflict in Christian terms, I would put it while Christ died for our sins, we are yet sinners. While some individuals assume ""Christlike"" natures, most of us do not even come close.  I realize that in many ways this is a trite answer, but I guess that it is my way of rationalizing man's constant (or so it seems) conflict.   ---------------------------------------------------------------------  Jerry Kemp (Somtime Consultant) Internet: kempja@rcwusr.bp.com kemp_ja@tnd001.dnet.bp.com "

The ""so sacred it's secret"" explanation is a bit misleading.  While there is a profound reverence for the temple endowment, there is no injunction against discussing the ceremony itself in public.  But since public discussion is often irreverent, most Mormons would rather keep silent than have a cherished practice maligned.  But there are certain elements of the ceremony which participants explicitly covenant not to reveal except in conjunction with the ceremony itself.  | Granted, the Gnostic ""Christians"" | had their secret rituals, but these seem to have been taken entirely | from pagan pre-Christian mystery religions.  There are other interpretations to Christian history in this matter. One must recall that most of what we know about the Gnostics was written by their enemies.  Eusebius claims that Jesus imparted secret information to Peter, James, and John after His resurrection, and that those apostles transmitted that information to the rest of the Twelve (Eusebius, _Historia Ecclesiastica_ II 1:3-4).  Irenaeus claims this information was passed on to the priests and bishops (_Against Heresies_ IV 33:8), but Eusebius disagrees.  He claims the secret ceremonies of the Christian church perished with the apostles.  Interestingly enough, Eusebius refers to the groups which we today call Gnostics as promulgators of a false gnosis (Eusebius, op. cit., III, 32:7-8).  His gripe was not that thay professed *a* gnosis, but that they had the *wrong* one.  Writings dealing with Jesus' post-resurrection teachings emphasize secrecy -- not so much a concealment as a policy of not teaching certain things indiscriminately.  In one story, Simon Magus opens a dialog with Peter on the nature of God.  Peter's response is ""You seem to me not to know what a father and a God is: But I could tell you both whence souls are, and when and how they were made; but it is not permitted to me now to disclose these things to you"" (_Clementine Recognitions_ II, 60).  If any one theme underlies the _Recognitions_ it is the idea that certain doctrines are not to be idly taught, but can be had after a certain level of spiritual maturity is reached.  Now one can approach this and other such evidence in many ways.  I don't intend that everyone interpret Christian history as I do, but I believe that evidence exists (favorably interpreted, of course) of early Christian rites analogous to those practiced by Mormons today.  | Neither New Testament | Christianity nor Biblical Judaism made a secret of their practices.  But if Judaism and Christianity had such ceremonies, would you expect to read about them in public documents?  One can search the Book of Mormon and other Mormon scripture and find almost no information on temple worship.  Yes, you could establish that Mormons worship in temples, but you would probably be hard pressed to characterize that worship.  On that basis, can we conclude that the Bible explains *all* practices which might have taken place, and that absence of such descriptions proves they did not exist?  Mormon scholar Dr. Hugh Nibley offers us a list of scriptures from which I have taken a few:  1. ""It is given unto you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given"" (Matt. 13:11).  2. ""All men cannot receive this saying, save they to whom it is given"" (Matt. 19:11).  3. ""I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now"" (John 16:12).  4. ""The time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father"" (John 16:25).  5. ""... unspeakable words, which it is not lawful for a man to utter"" (1 Cor. 3:1-2).  6. ""Many things ... I would not write with paper and ink; but I ... come unto you and speak face to face"" (2 Jn. 1:12).  (Nibley, _Since Cumorah_, pp. 92-94)  Again, these can also be interpreted many different ways.  I believe they serve to show that not all doctrines which could have been taught were actually taught openly.  | I have heard that Joseph Smith took the entire | practice (i.e. both the ritual and the secrecy surrounding the ritual) | from the Freemasons.  Anybody in the know have any authoritative | information on whether or not this claim is true?  Historically, Joseph Smith had been adiministering the temple endowment ceremony for nearly a year before joining the Freemasons. There is diary evidence which supports a claim that the rite did not change after Smith became a Mason.  It can be argued that Smith had ample exposure to Masonic proceedings through the burlesque of his time and through his brother Hyrum (a Mason), though no specific connection has yet been established.  My conversations with Masons (with respect to temple rite transcriptions which have appeared on the net) have led me to believe that the connection from Masonry to Mormonism is fairly tenuous.  As our moderator notes, most of what was similar was removed in the recent revisions to the temple ceremony.  I believe that critics who charge that Mormon rites were lifted from Freemasonry do not have adequate knowledge of the rites in question. -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Jay Windley  *  University of Utah  *  Salt Lake City jwindley@asylum.cs.utah.edu ------------------------------------------------------------------------ "

(Sunday by any other name in modern parlance.)  Why is there so much objection to observing the Resurrection on the 1st day of the week on which it actually occured?

I'd like to suggest that people think very carefully about this argument.  Words often change their meaning over time.  The days of the week are of course originally based on pagan gods.  Some Christians prefer to refer to ""first day"", ""second day"", etc.  However the majority of Christians have not been persuaded.  The question seems to be whether it makes any difference what the dictionary shows as the derivation of a word, if what people mean by it and think when they use it is different.  Indeed I'd like to suggest that postings like this could themselves be dangerous.  Suppose people in general use Easter to mean the celebration of Christ's resurrection.  Postings trying to convince them that they really mean a celebration in honor of some godess run the risk of creating exactly the situation that they claim to oppose. They are doing their best to *create* a linkage in people's minds between their celebration and the pagan goddess.  It's not clear that this is a healthy thing.  --clh] "

Thus while I believe that no gods exist, this does ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ > not imply *faith* on my part that it is so. ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Let me first say that ""to believe that no gods exist"" is in fact different than ""not believing in a god or gods"".  I will argue that your latter statement, ""I believe that no gods exist"" does rest upon faith - that is, if you are making a POSITIVE statement that ""no gods exist"" (strong atheism) rather than merely saying I don't know and therefore don't believe in them and don't NOT believe in then (weak atheism). Once again, to not believe in God is different than saying I BELIEVE that God does not exist. I still maintain the position, even after reading the FAQs, that strong atheism requires faith.  But first let me say the following. We might have a language problem here - in regards to ""faith"" and ""existence"". I, as a Christian, maintain that God does not exist. To exist means to have being in space and time. God does not HAVE being - God IS Being. Kierkegaard once said that God does not exist, He is eternal. With this said, I feel it's rather pointless to debate the so called ""existence"" of God - and that is not what I'm doing here. I believe that God is the source and ground of being. When you say that ""god does not exist"", I also accept this statement - but we obviously mean two different things by it. However, in what follows I will use the phrase ""the existence of God"" in it's 'usual sense' - and this is the sense that I think you are using it. I would like a clarification upon what you mean by ""the existence of God"".  We also might differ upon what it means to have faith. Here is what Webster says:  faith 1a: allegiance to duty or a person: LOYALTY b  (1): fidelity to one's promises (2): sincerity of intentions 2a (1): belief and trust in and loyalty to God (2): belief in the traditional doctrines of a religion b  (1): firm belief in something for which there is no proof ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ (2): complete trust 3: something that is believed esp. with strong conviction; esp: a system ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ of religious beliefs syn see BELIEF    One can never prove that God does or does not exist. When you say that you believe God does not exist, and that this is an opinion ""based upon observation"", I will have to ask ""what observtions are you refering to?"" There are NO observations - pro or con - that are valid here in establishing a POSITIVE belief. All observations can only point you in a direction - a direction that we might even be predisposed to (by predisposed I mean, for example, people whoes partents ""believe in God"" also tend to). To actually draw a conclusion about the ""existence"" or ""non-existence"" of God requires a leap - and you have made this leap when you actively say ""I believe that God does/does not exist"". Personally, I think that both statements are misguided. Arguing over the ""existence"" of God is precisely the wrong way to find Him (and yes, I use ""Him"" because a personal God is the only viable concept (IMO) - if a person wants to use ""She"" go ahead. Of course God is neither He nor She - but we have no choice but to anthropomorphise. If you want me to explain myself further I'll be glad to.)    And please, if someone does not agree with me - even if they violently disagree - it's in no ones advantage to start name calling. If a person thinks I've misunderstood something in the FAQs, or if they they think I have not read them well enough, just point out to me the error of my ways and I correct the situation. I'm interested in a polite and well thought out discussion.         > Cheers > > Simon > -- > Simon Clippingdale                simon@dcs.warwick.ac.uk > Department of Computer Science    Tel (+44) 203 523296 > University of Warwick             FAX (+44) 203 525714 > Coventry CV4 7AL, U.K.  -- bob singleton bobs@thnext.mit.edu "

April 6, 1993  RELEASE:  93-64  Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""  NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.  ------- End of Blind-Carbon-Copy "

Your mileage may vary.  Yes I fully agree with that, but is it ""I don't believe gods exist"", or ""I believe no gods exist""? As MANDTBACKA@FINABO.ABO.FI (Mats Andtbacka) pointed out, it all hinges on what you take the word ""believe"" to mean.  Unfortunately this is bound up in the definitions of strong and weak atheism, at least according to the FAQ:  # Atheism is characterized by an absence of belief in the existence of God. # Some atheists go further, and believe that God does not exist.  The former is # often referred to as the ""weak atheist"" position, and the latter as ""strong # atheism"". # # It is important to note the difference between these two positions.  ""Weak # atheism"" is simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  ""Strong # atheism"" is a positive belief that God does not exist.  Please do not # fall into the trap of assuming that all atheists are ""strong atheists"".

soc.religion.christian	 From: hedrick@cs.rutgers.edu Subject: Re: Doing the work of God??!!) Lines: 59  Desiree Bradley (Desiree_Bradley@mindlink.bc.ca) asked us whether we should think of the Serbs as doing God's work in Bosnia.  I've refrained from posting, in hope that someone who is more familiar with the OT than I would answer.  But at this point I feel I have to say something.  Many things about this posting bother me.  I know of not the slightest suggestion in the NT that Christians should use force to propagate the Gospel, and the idea that we should not be concerned about the death of Moslems violates the heart of the Gospel.  Christ died to break down these distinctions.  In him there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female.  If Moslems do not know him, we may preach to them, but we don't kill them.  Furthermore, the attack is between states, not religions. There are Christians being attacked as well.  One of the towns under attack is one of the few places where Christians and Moslems are living together peacefully.  The precedents being suggested are from the OT.  There are in fact two different things being alluded to.  The first is from the entry into Canaan.  For that to be a parallel, we would need for God to have promised this land through a prophet.  And we would need the war to be a holy war.  There were tight constraints on behavior in those attacks.  Any violations were likely to cause the Israelites to be defeated.  Rape would not have been tolerated.  While the accounts in Joshua emphasize towns that were totally destroyed, note that it was possible for a town to make peace with the Israelites, and that once that was done -- even when deception was involved -- they were expected to honor it.  In contrast, there have been many violations of agreement in this incident. I see no evidence that God has granted Bosnia to the Serbs as a promised land, and if he had, their behavior would have disqualified this from being a holy war.  The other OT parallel is from later, when Israel was defeated by Assyria and Babylonia.  The prophets saw this as a judgement on Israel for her sins.  Someone asks whether we shouldn't see this as a judgement on the Bosnians for their sins.  This sounds like a replay of the old claim that we shouldn't have doctors or hospitals because illness is God's judgement.  Yes, even bad things may be used by God for good.  That includes actions of bad people.  But that doesn't justify them.  If you read the prophets, you find them very clear that in attacking Israel, the Assyrians and Babylonians were acting as *unintentional* agents of God.  Their intent was to attack God's people, and they would be judged for it.  The fact that they were actually carrying out God's plan didn't excuse their action. Furthermore, we shouldn't conclude from this that all attacks are judgements from God.  God explicitly interpreted that case, through his prophets.  As far as I know, he did not send any prophets to Bosnia.  While I find it hard to see any good in the current fighting, I am sure God will eventually make good come out of bad.  But that doesn't justify it, and it won't save the people who are doing it from judgement.  I am particularly concerned about the implications of this issue because of current tensions between the West and Moslem-oriented nations.  What we do not need is for Moslems to conclude that Christians think it's OK to kill Moslems.  The implications for the mid-East, and even relations with American Moslems, could be quite serious.

Correct me if I am wrong, but it appears that the views of Messianic Jews on metaphysics is different to that of the majority of Jews. While Jewish theology overall is quite distinct from the Christianic god views, I have heard that it is possible for Jews to attribute evil to their god, an no-no for Christians, the Bible is still seen as effect of the interaction of some god with man.

Either there is some connection between the text, the fact that it exists, and your interpretation of it, or it is purely arbitrary.. Further, the question is why is has one to carry the burden of Biblical texts when one could simply write other books that convey the message better. You might answer that one can't becuase  some peculiar Biblical information might be lost, but that holds true of every other book, and the question remains why has the Bible still a special place?

And the argument you have given is a fallacy, while it may not be important in the context you have given to find out if god is corporeal or not, it can be crucial in other questions. Religious believers resolve contradictions with that they choose one of the possibilities given in an arbitrary way, and have the advantage of being able to attribute their decision to some god.  One cannot resolve questions by the statement do what is good when what is good depends on the question. Benedikt "

People refuse to believe my messengers.  Even when I was alive here on earth, they refuse Me.  What more when I am just talking through somebody else?"" (paraphrased).  With all the knowledge believers accumulated, He would think that we would be 'enlightened' enough to detect which ones are 'authentic and divine' as opposed to 'evil or man-made'.  These signs, these miracles, are you afraid that they are not from God? That these are the signs we should not open our hearts and mind to for thinking they are evil? Well, is faith in God evil? Is true peace evil?  Is true love that is divine and pure evil? Why can't someone accept that God can do what He wants in fulfillment of His generous love and Jesus' never ending forgiveness to those who turn back to Him for salvation? Why are we refusing God's messenger of this truth?  The mother to all who are in Christ? What brings us these: fears of being shamed by what others will think or say about us? which, in contrary, could be pleasing to God? fears of being humbled? fears of being judged as wrong (wrt mainstream standard of what is right)? Why can't we tolerate non-believers' mockery or ridicule of us for the sake of peace, love and obedience to God?  The humbling lessons left to us by martyrs and saints? We'd rather engage in never-ending bickering and disproof of each other's opinion - looking at each other's mistakes - for the sake of arguments, instead of having communion in one body with Christ. What makes us go blind to the truth that God is All Powerful and that He can not be binded by what people wrote and have written about Him in all ages? Why is our faith in God limited?  By all the words and literature we muster? What prevents us from going *beyond* being saved and extend God's rich love to others who are not?  Why are our eyes not wide open to see that He continuously sees our faith, hope and love which glorify Him and so He gives us indications of His acknowledgements with signs/miracles (ordinary/common or divinely inspired) everywhere?  Isn't that like an atheist/agnostic's view that all these are just ordinary here on earth and not caused by anything supernatural?  Why then does the Holy Mother comes back to remind us: ""We must really __accept that prayer__ changes the course of things and that with prayers __even wars can be prevented__."" but then she continues: ""You often have an egotistic attitude.  Dear children, in these days you have prayed very much, __but your hands have remained empty__."" Why hesitate in proclaiming what needs to be done: ""prayer, conversion, peace, penance, fasting, the Holy Mass, living life as what the Gospel brings.""? Why not do so?  How?  To the world? To this, the Mother says: ""Start in your family.  Be a good example.  Live the Word."" Why worry if it is going to be of good use to many? Our Holy Mother says: ""The fruits, __leave them to the Lord__, do not worry about anything or anyone but entrust yourself to the Lord.""  Although the Holy Mother does not insist because: ""You are free; I bow before the freedom which God gives you."" but she follows this with: ""You are surprised because I say to you: Decide for God and yet, see how you have lived this day."" Why does she constantly conveys: ""Take this life toward God in the way as to __experience__ the Lord Himself in your __behavior__ and __not only__ when you pray"" or one time when we decide that we are saved, or talk/write about God, etc. The Holy Mother warns: ""Satan (the serpent) is always trying to dissuade you to turn you away from my peace plan and prayer.""  (Rev 12:17, the dragon became angry with the woman and went off to wage war against the rest of her offsprings, those who keep God's commandments, and bear witness to Jesus.)  Do you have fear or hate for God's current messenger of true peace, love and our motherly protector from the anti-Christ? The one who is being apprehensive of communism, wars, famine and other evils that the serpent brings upon us? This obedient and blessed new Eve? The mother who warns us so we can be prepared and be strong against Satan? Haven't there been renewed faith, hope, love, peace and obedience wherever this messenger has shared her blessings and graces that God has given her in good purpose? Why do we choose to be blind? Why fear the truth that God has been giving us a chance and sharing Christ's ever-forgetting forgiveness to us through the obedient mother? The mother who has been consecrated the task __to reverse__ the disobedient harm and example done by the ancient Eve. She has been preparing the new Eden with her Immaculate Heart.

Shouldn't we give her a hand in her exhaustive job of preparing us for the second coming of her Son as she has been conceived without sin to bear the Son of God in her womb? Why fear true peace, love and renewed faith and obedience to God that Mary faithfully brings to God's children?  She has been protecting the flock (the rest of the offsprings) from the greedy dragon so as to present more righteous members for her Son's coming. Not all apparitions and miracles that resulted from them are worthy of belief.  With prayer and guidance from the Holy Spirit and, of course, approval of our Church authorities, we should be aware of the true and divinely inspired ones; specifically, the ones which aligns with the Scripture.   Also, our Lady reminds us of recommendation of __silence__ in our prayers: ""If you speak unceasingly in your prayers, how will you be able to hear God?  Allow Him room to answer you, to speak to you.""  She encourages us (with motherly nurturing) to continue in exuberant faith, hope and love to Jesus, constantly.  NOT with mere emotions, but with deep, constant obedience to Jesus, her Beloved Son and acknowledgement of our need to have Him as part of our lives.  Let's not wait to the last minute to renew our faith and the life that God wants us to live; when there won't be enough time or when it will be late.  Nowadays, Mary says, ""Pray, pray, pray for peace...reconciliation, my children."" Have peace within yourself first before you can promote peace to others.  For without peace, you can not fully accept my Son.""   And you think she's just an ordinary lady.  Not to me.  She's our good Mother/messenger from God and she is so nice enough to share God's kingdom to us through her Son and experience it.  With Mary, we are assured that The Lamb always succeeds.  ----- Note:  All enclosed in quotes are from ""Latest News of Medjugorje"" Number 10, June, 1991 by Fr.

Points covered here are ones which are not covered in the ""Introduction to Atheism""; you are advised to read that article as well before posting.  These answers are not intended to be exhaustive or definitive. The purpose of the periodic FAQ postings is not to stifle debate, but to raise its level. If you have something to say concerning one of these questions and which isn't covered by the answer given, please feel free to make your point.

Typical posting:  Why have a newsgroup about atheism?  Why do atheists organize in groups? What is there to discuss?  Response:  Many things are discussed here, including:  * Whether it is reasonable to feign theism in order to avoid upsetting one's family * Prayer in schools * Discrimination against atheists * Sunday trading laws * The Satanic Child Abuse myth * Whether one should be an overt atheist or 'stay in the closet' * How religious societies prey (sic) on new college students * How to get rid of unwanted proselytizers * Whether religion is a danger to society and/or the individual * Why people become atheists  Of course, inevitably alt.atheism tends to attract evangelical Christians looking for someone to convert.  Most readers of the newsgroup don't want to be preached to, although a few seem to derive perverse pleasure from tearing apart particularly ill-considered or uninformed postings.  ------------------------------  Subject: Hitler was an atheist!  Typical posting:  Hitler was an atheist, and look at what he did!  Response:  Adolf Hitler was emphatically not an atheist.  As he said himself:  The folkish-minded man, in particular, has the sacred duty, each in his own denomination, of making _people_stop_just_talking_ superficially_of_God's_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God's_will,_and_ not_let_God's_word_be_desecrated._[orig. ital.]  For God's will gave men their form, their essence, and their abilities.  Anyone who destroys His work is declaring war on the Lord's creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be active, each in his own denomination if you please, and let every man take it as his first and most sacred duty to oppose anyone who in his activity by word or deed steps outside the confines of his religious community and tries to butt into the other.  [...]  Hence today I believe that I am acting in accordance with the will of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_ fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]  -- Adolf Hitler, from ""Mein Kampf"", trans. Ralph Mannheim.  Of course, someone bad believing something does not make that belief wrong.  It's also entirely possible that Hitler was lying when he claimed to believe in God.  We certainly can't conclude that he's an atheist, though.  ------------------------------  Subject: The Bible proves it  Typical posting:  In the Bible it says that...  Response:  Most of the readers of alt.atheism feel that the Bible is of questionable accuracy, as it was written thousands of years ago by many authors who were recording oral tradition that existed many years before.  Thus, any claimed 'truth' in it is of questionable legitimacy.  This isn't to say that The Bible has no truth in it; simply that any truth must be examined before being accepted.  Many of the readers of this group also feel that because any passage is subject to ""interpretation"", any claim that a passage 'means' one thing and one thing only is not legitimate.  Note that this feeling tends to extend to other books.  It is also remarkable to many atheists that theists tend to ignore other equally plausible religious books in favour of those of their own religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: Pascal's Wager  Typical posting:  If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing -- but if you don't believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to hell. Therefore it is foolish to be an atheist.  Response:  This argument is known as Pascal's Wager.  It has several flaws.  Firstly, it does not indicate which religion to follow.  Indeed, there are many mutually exclusive and contradictory religions out there.  This is often described as the ""avoiding the wrong hell"" problem.  If a person is a follower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y's version of hell.  Secondly, the statement that ""If you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost nothing"" is not true.  Suppose you're believing in the wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishness. Consider also the deaths that have resulted from people rejecting medicine in favour of prayer.  Another flaw in the argument is that it is based on the assumption that the two possibilities are equally likely -- or at least, that they are of comparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there being a God is close to zero, the argument becomes much less persuasive.  So sadly the argument is only likely to convince those who believe already.  Also, many feel that for intellectually honest people, belief is based on evidence, with some amount of intuition.  It is not a matter of will or cost-benefit analysis.  Formally speaking, the argument consists of four statements:  1. One does not know whether God exists. 2. Not believing in God is bad for one's eternal soul if God does exist. 3. Believing in God is of no consequence if God does not exist. 4. Therefore it is in one's interest to believe in God.  There are two approaches to the argument.  The first is to view 1 as an assumption, and 2 as a consequence of it.  One problem with this approach, in the abstract, is that it creates information from no information.  This is considered invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicates one has no information about God -- but statement 2 indicates that beneficial information can be gained from the absolute lack of information about God.  This violates information entropy -- information has been extracted from no information, at no ""cost"".  The alternative approach is to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumptions.  The problem with this is that 2 is then basically an assumption which states the Christian position, and only a Christian will agree with that assumption. The argument thus collapses to ""If you are a Christian, it is in your interests to believe in God"" -- a rather vacuous tautology, and not the way Pascal intended the argument to be viewed.  The biggest reason why Pascal's wager is a failure is that if God is omniscient he will certainly know who really believes and who believes as a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assuming he actually cares at all whether people believe in him.  ------------------------------  Subject: What is Occam's Razor?  Typical posting:  People keep talking about Occam's Razor.  What is it?  Response:  William of Occam formulated a principle which has become known as Occam's Razor.  In its original form, it said ""Do not multiply entities unnecessarily.""  That is, if you can explain something without supposing the existence of some entity, then do so.  Nowadays when people refer to Occam's Razor, they generally express it more generally, for example as ""Take the simplest solution"".  The relevance to atheism is that we can look at two possible explanations for what we see around us:  1. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, which came into being as a result of natural processes.  2. There is an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there, and there is also a God who created the universe.  Clearly this God must be of non-zero complexity.  Given that both explanations fit the facts, Occam's Razor might suggest that we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one. Unfortunately, some argue that there is a third even more simple solution:  3. There isn't an incredibly intricate and complex universe out there. We just imagine that there is.  This third option leads us logically towards solipsism, which many people find unacceptable.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why it's good to believe in Jesus  Typical posting:  I want to tell people about the virtues and benefits of my religion.  Response:  Preaching is not appreciated.  Feel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write postings that are on a ""conversion"" theme.  Such postings do not belong on alt.atheism and will be rejected from alt.atheism.moderated (try the newsgroup talk.religion.misc).  You would doubtless not welcome postings from atheists to your favourite newsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto others as you would have them do unto you!  Often theists make their basic claims about God in the form of lengthy analogies or parables.  Be aware that atheists have heard of God and know the basic claims about him; if the sole purpose of your parable is to tell atheists that God exists and brings salvation, you may as well not post it, since it tells us nothing we have not been told before.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why I know that God exists  Typical posting:  I *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exists.  Response:  Just as many theists have personal evidence that the being they worship exists, so many atheists have personal evidence that such beings do not exist.  That evidence varies from person to person.  Furthermore, without wishing to dismiss your evidence out of hand, many people have claimed all kinds of unlikely things -- that they have been abducted by UFOs, visited by the ghost of Elvis, and so on.  ------------------------------  Subject: Einstein and ""God does not play dice""  Typical posting:  Albert Einstein believed in God.  Do you think you're cleverer than him?  Response:  Einstein did once comment that ""God does not play dice [with the universe]"". This quotation is commonly mentioned to show that Einstein believed in the Christian God.  Used this way, it is out of context; it refers to Einstein's refusal to accept the uncertainties indicated by quantum theory. Furthermore, Einstein's religious background was Jewish rather than Christian.  A better quotation showing what Einstein thought about God is the following: ""I believe in Spinoza's God who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.""  Einstein was unable to accept Quantum Theory because of his belief in an objective, orderly reality; a reality which would not be subject to random events and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believed that QM was incomplete, and that a better theory would have no need for statistical interpretations.  So far no such better theory has been found, and much evidence suggests that it never will be.  A longer quote from Einstein appears in ""Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A Symposium"", published by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion in Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In it he says:  ""The more a man is imbued with the ordered regularity of all events the firmer becomes his conviction that there is no room left by the side of this ordered regularity for causes of a different nature.  For him neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exists as an independent cause of natural events.  To be sure, the doctrine of a personal God interfering with natural events could never be *refuted* [italics his], in the real sense, by science, for this doctrine can always take refuge in those domains in which scientific knowledge has not yet been able to set foot.  But I am convinced that such behavior on the part of representatives of religion would not only be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine which is to maintain itself not in clear light but only in the dark, will of necessity lose its effect on mankind, with incalculable harm to human progress.  In their struggle for the ethical good, teachers of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal God, that is, give up that source of fear and hope which in the past placed such vast power in the hands of priests.  In their labors they will have to avail themselves of those forces which are capable of cultivating the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity itself.  This is, to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparably more worthy task...""  Einstein has also said:  ""It was, of course, a lie what you read about my religous convictions, a lie which is being systematically repeated.  I do not believe in a personal God and I have never denied this but have expressed it clearly. If something is in me which can be called religious then it is the unbounded admiration for the structure of the world so far as our science can reveal it.""  The latter quote is from ""Albert Einstein: The Human Side"", edited by Helen Dukas and Banesh Hoffman, and published by Princeton University Press. Also from the same book:  ""I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethics to be an exclusively human concern with no superhuman authority behind it.""  Of course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity does not in itself imply that Christianity is false.  ------------------------------  Subject: Everyone worships something  Typical posting:  Everyone worships something, whether it's money, power or God.  Response:  If that is true, everyone is a polytheist.  Theists care just as much about those things that atheists care about.  If the atheists' reactions to (for example) their families amount to worship then so do the theists'.  ------------------------------  Subject: Why there must be a causeless cause  Typical posting:  Sets of integers that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so chains of causes must all have a first element, a causeless cause.  Response:  The set of real numbers greater than zero has a definite lower bound, but has no smallest member.  Further, even if it is true that there must be a causeless cause, that does not imply that that cause must be a conscious supernatural entity, and especially not that any such entity must match the description favoured by any particular religion.  ------------------------------  Subject: The universe is so complex it must have been designed  Typical posting:  The presence of design in the universe proves there is a God.  Surely you don't think all this appeared here just by chance?  Response:  This is known as the Argument From Design.  It is a matter of dispute whether there is any element of design in the universe. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of living creatures on the earth is evidence of a creator are best advised to read the newsgroup talk.origins for a while.  There is insufficient space to summarize both sides of that debate here. However, the conclusion is that there is no scientific evidence in favour of so-called Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there is much evidence, observation and theory that can explain many of the complexities of the universe and life on earth.  The origin of the Argument by Design is a feeling that the existence of something as incredibly intricate as, say, a human is so improbable that surely it can't have come about by chance; that surely there must be some external intelligence directing things so that humans come from the chaos deliberately.  But if human intelligence is so improbable, surely the existence of a mind capable of fashioning an entire universe complete with conscious beings must be immeasurably more unlikely?  The approach used to argue in favour of the existence of a creator can be turned around and applied to the Creationist position.  This leads us to the familiar theme of ""If a creator created the universe, what created the creator?"", but with the addition of spiralling improbability.  The only way out is to declare that the creator was not created and just ""is"" (or ""was"").  From here we might as well ask what is wrong with saying that the universe just ""is"" without introducing a creator?  Indeed Stephen Hawking, in his book ""A Brief History of Time"", explains his theory that the universe is closed and finite in extent, with no beginning or end.  The Argument From Design is often stated by analogy, in the so-called Watchmaker Argument.  One is asked to imagine that one has found a watch on the beach.  Does one assume that it was created by a watchmaker, or that it evolved naturally?  Of course one assumes a watchmaker.  Yet like the watch, the universe is intricate and complex; so, the argument goes, the universe too must have a creator.  The Watchmaker analogy suffers from three particular flaws, over and above those common to all Arguments By Design.  Firstly, a watchmaker creates watches from pre-existing materials, whereas God is claimed to have created the universe from nothing.  These two sorts of creation are clearly fundamentally different, and the analogy is therefore rather weak.  Secondly, a watchmaker makes watches, but there are many other things in the world.  If we walked further along the beach and found a nuclear reactor, we wouldn't assume it was created by the watchmaker.  The argument would therefore suggest a multitude of creators, each responsible for a different part of creation.  Finally, in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that the watch is not part of nature because it is ordered, and therefore stands out from the randomness of nature.  Yet in the second part of the argument, we start from the position that the universe is obviously not random, but shows elements of order.  The Watchmaker argument is thus internally inconsistent.  ------------------------------  Subject: Independent evidence that the Bible is true  Typical posting:  The events of the New Testament are confirmed by independent documentary evidence.  For example...  Response:  The writings of Josephus are often mentioned as independent documentary evidence.  Early versions of Josephus's work are thought not to have mentioned Jesus or James; the extant version discusses John in a non-Christian context.  Many scholars believe that the original mentioned Jesus and James in passing, but that this was expanded by Christian copyists.  Several ""reconstructions"" of the original text have been published to this effect.  Much information appears in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius (about 320 C.E.).  It is worthless as historical material because of the deliberate falsification of the wily Eusebius who is generally acknowledged as 'the first thoroughly dishonest historian of antiquity.' It is Eusebius who is generally given the title of authorship for this material.  Aside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesus is more well-documented.  For further information, please consult the Frequently Asked Questions file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.  ------------------------------  Subject: Godel's Incompleteness Theorem  Typical posting:  Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible for the Bible to be both true and complete.  Response:  Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem says that in any consistent formal system which is sufficiently expressive that it can model ordinary arithmetic, one can formulate expressions which can never be proven to be valid or invalid ('true' or 'false') within that formal system.  (Technically speaking, the system must also be recursive; that is, there must be a decision procedure for determining whether a given string is an axiom within the formal system.)  Essentially, all such systems can formulate what is known as a ""Liar Paradox.""  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English is ""This sentence is false.""  Note that if a proposition is undecidable, the formal system cannot even deduce that it is undecidable.  The logic used in theological discussions is rarely well defined, so claims that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that it is impossible to prove or disprove) the existence of God are worthless in isolation.  One can trivially define a formal system in which it is possible to prove the existence of God, simply by having the existence of God stated as an axiom. This is unlikely to be viewed by atheists as a convincing proof, however.  It may be possible to succeed in producing a formal system built on axioms that both atheists and theists agree with.  It may then be possible to show that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem holds for that system.  However, that would still not demonstrate that it is impossible to prove that God exists within the system.  Furthermore, it certainly wouldn't tell us anything about whether it is possible to prove the existence of God generally.  Note also that all of these hypothetical formal systems tell us nothing about the actual existence of God; the formal systems are just abstractions.  Another frequent claim is that Godel's Incompleteness Theorem demonstrates that a religious text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be both consistent and universally applicable. Religious texts are not formal systems, so such claims are nonsense.  ------------------------------  Subject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism  Typical posting:  Did George Bush really say that atheists should not be considered citizens?  Response:  The following exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I. Sherman of American Atheist Press and George Bush, on August 27 1988. Sherman is a fully accredited reporter, and was present by invitation as a member of the press corps.  The Republican presidential nominee was there to announce federal disaster relief for Illinois.  The discussion turned to the presidential primary:  RS: ""What will you do to win the votes of Americans who are atheists?""  GB: ""I guess I'm pretty weak in the atheist community.  Faith in God is important to me.""  RS: ""Surely you recognize the equal citizenship and patriotism of Americans who are atheists?""  GB: ""No, I don't know that atheists should be considered as citizens, nor should they be considered patriots.  This is one nation under God.""  RS: ""Do you support as a sound constitutional principle the separation of state and church?""  GB: ""Yes, I support the separation of church and state.  I'm just not very high on atheists.""  UPI reported on May 8, 1989, that various atheist organizations were still angry over the remarks.  The exchange appeared in the Boulder Daily Camera on Monday February 27, 1989.  It can also be found in ""Free Enquiry"" magazine, Fall 1988 issue, Volume 8, Number 4, page 16.  On October 29, 1988, Mr. Sherman had a confrontation with Ed Murnane, cochairman of the Bush-Quayle '88 Illinois campaign.  This concerned a lawsuit Mr. Sherman had filed to stop the Community Consolidated School District 21 (Chicago, Illinois) from forcing his first-grade Atheist son to pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States as ""one nation under God"" (Bush's phrase).  The following conversation took place:  RS: ""American Atheists filed the Pledge of Allegiance lawsuit yesterday. Does the Bush campaign have an official response to this filing?""  EM: ""It's bullshit.""  RS: ""What is bullshit?""  EM: ""Everything that American Atheists does, Rob, is bullshit.""  RS: ""Thank you for telling me what the official position of the Bush campaign is on this issue.""  EM: ""You're welcome.""  After Bush's election, American Atheists wrote to Bush asking him to retract his statement.  On February 21st 1989, C. Boyden Gray, Counsel to the President, replied on White House stationery that Bush substantively stood by his original statement, and wrote:  ""As you are aware, the President is a religious man who neither supports atheism nor believes that atheism should be unnecessarily encouraged or supported by the government.""

Typical posting:  I know where Hell is!  Hell is in Norway!  Response:  There are several towns called ""Hell"" in various countries around the world, including Norway and the USA.  Whilst this information is mildly amusing the first time one hears it, readers of alt.atheism are now getting pretty fed up with hearing it every week.  ------------------------------  Subject: Biblical contradictions wanted  Typical posting:  Does anyone have a list of Biblical contradictions?  Response:  American Atheist Press publish an atheist's handbook detailing Biblical contradictions. See the accompanying posting on Atheist Resources for details.  There is a file containing some Biblical contradictions available from the archive-server@mantis.co.uk. See the contacts file for more information.  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Because of the religious beliefs of the founding fathers, shouldn't the United States be considered a Christian nation?  Response:  Based upon the writings of several important founding fathers, it is clear that they never intended the US to be a Christian nation.  Here are some quotes; there are many more.  ""What influence, in fact, have ecclesiastical establishments had on society? In some instances they have been seen to erect a spiritual tyranny on the ruins of the civil authority; on many instances they have been seen upholding the thrones of political tyranny; in no instance have they been the guardians of the liberties of the people.  Rulers who wish to subvert the public liberty may have found an established clergy convenient auxiliaries. A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate it, needs them not."" - James Madison, ""A Memorial and Remonstrance"", 1785  ""I almost shudder at the thought of alluding to the most fatal example of the abuses of grief which the history of mankind has preserved--the Cross. Consider what calamities that engine of grief has produced!"" - John Adams, in a letter to Thomas Jefferson  ""History I believe furnishes no example of a priest-ridden people maintaining a free civil government.  This marks the lowest grade of ignorance, of which their political as well as religious leaders will always avail themselves for their own purpose.""  - Thomas Jefferson to Baron von Humboldt, 1813  ""I cannot conceive otherwise than that He, the Infinite Father, expects or requires no worship or praise from us, but that He is even infinitely above it.""  - Benjamin Franklin, from ""Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion"", Nov. 20, 1728  ------------------------------  Subject: The USA is not a Christian nation  Typical posting:  Is it true that George Washington said that the United States is not in any sense founded upon the Christian religion?  Response:  No.  The quotation often given is in fact from Article XI of the 1797 Treaty of Tripoli (8 Stat 154, Treaty Series 358):  Article 11  As the government of the United States of America is not in any sense founded on the Christian Religion, -- as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion or tranquility of Musselmen, -- and as the said States never have entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mehomitan nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries.  The text may be found in the Congressional Record or in treaty collections such as Charles Bevans' ""Treaties and Other International Agreements of the United States of America 1776-1949"", vol. 11 (pp. 1070-1080).  The English text of the Treaty of Tripoli was approved by the U.S. Senate on June 7, 1797 and ratified by President John Adams on June 10, 1797.  It was recently discovered that the Arabic version of the treaty not only lacks the quotation, it lacks Article XI altogether.  The person who translated the Arabic to English was Joel Barlow, Consul General at Algiers, a close friend of Thomas Paine -- and an opponent of Christianity.  It is possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there is no Arabic version of that article to be found, it's hard to say.  In 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli was ratified which no longer contained the quotation.   End of FAQ Digest *****************  "

I Peter 3:7  One interpretation I've heard of this verse is that it refers to the sin of physically abusing one's wife.  The husband is usually physically stronger than his wife but is not permitted to use this to dominate her. He must honor her as his sister in Christ.  This would therefore be an example of a specific sin that blocks prayer.  This verse also makes me think of the kind of husband who decides what is God's will for his family without consulting his wife.  God reveals His will to both the husband and the wife.  There needs to be some degree of mutuality in decision making.  Even those whose understanding of the Bible leads to a belief in an authoritarian headship of the husband need to incorporate this in order to have a functional family. One way to look at it is that God speaks to the wife through the husband and to the husband through the wife.   Jayne Kulikauskas/ jayne@mmalt.guild.org "

I would describe myself as an agnostic, in so far as I'm sure there is no single, universal supreme being, but if there is one and it is just, we will surely be judged on whether we lived good lives, striving to achieve that goodness that is within the power of each of us.  Now, the complication is that one of my best friends has become very fundamentalist.  That would normally be a non-issue with me, but he feels it is his responsibility to proselytize me (which I guess it is, according to his faith).  This is a great strain to our friendship.  I would have no problem if the subject didn't come up, but when it does, the discussion quickly begins to offend both of us: he is offended because I call into question his bedrock beliefs; I am offended by what I feel is a subscription to superstition, rationalized by such circular arguments as 'the Bible is God's word because He tells us in the Bible that it is so.'  So my question is, how can I convince him that this is a subject better left undiscussed, so we can preserve what is (in all areas other than religious beliefs) a great friendship?  How do I convince him that I am 'beyond saving' so he won't try?

Andrew Kille writes:  >Are you suggesting that God supports genocide? >Perhaps the Germans were ""punishing"" Jews on God's behalf? > >Any God who works that way is indescribably evil, and unworthy of >my worship or faith.  The Bible does tell us that governments are ordained by God (Romans 13). And furthermore, God foreknows everything that would happen.  It is just to difficult for humans to graps with our limited minds, the inevitablity of the sucess of God's plan, and this is especially hard to grasp when we see governemnts doing evil.  However, though they are doing evil (and we should not cooperate with them when they do such), it must be understood that what happens is what God wanted so as to lead to the final sucess of His plan to save as many souls from hell as is possible.  In short, the slaughter in Bosnia, though deplorable in the eyes of God (maybe, then again, they might be getting their just deserts now rather than later; there are plenty of examples of God killing people for their sins - Onan in the Old Testmament for example, and Annias and Spahira in the New) is what he willed to happen so that His plan might be accomplished. But don't forget, it is not unbiblical for God to use one nation to execute His just judgement upon another.  The Romans were used to fulfill the chorus of ""Let his blood be upon our hands"" of the crowd in Jersualem.  And Chaldea was chastised by Babylon, which got Israel, which was inturn gotten by Persia, etc.  God does use nations to punish other nations, as the Bible very clearly shows in the Old Testament. Don't you remember the words of God recorded in Daniel, ""Mene, mene, tekel, peres?""  Babylon had been weighed in the balance scales of God's justice, found severly wanting, and was thus given over to the Persians as their due punishment for their rebellion.  Another exammple is the extirmination of the Cannanites, ordered by God as the task of Israel. The Cannanites had been given their chance, found severly wanting, and the Great Judge, carried out His just sentence accrodingly.  I could go on with more examples, but I see little need to do so, as my point is quite clear. Two things need to be remembered at all times. 1) It is not up to us to question why God has ordered the world as He has.  In His divine Wisdom, He made the world as was best in His eyes, and like Paul says in Romans 9, the clay is not one to tlak back to the potter.  2) The message of Jesus Christ is as follows: ""Repent now, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.""  Jesus Christ did not allow any time for dilly-dallying - ""Let the dead bury the dead, come, follow me.""  There is not an infinite amount of time, rather Christ is passing by right now, calling people to follow Him and become fishers of men.  He does not say, ""well, alright, you can call me back in a week and see if my Kingdom fits in with your plans.""  He said ""Follow me.""  His message is NOT ""I'm just a sweety-pie who would never hurt a fly, you've got all the time in the world, and Divine Judgement, that's only a fairy tale.""  ""Our great God and Savior"" Jesus Christ (Titus 2.5) is also the just and righteous Judge of the world.  And it is not up to the defendants in the trial to be questioning his entirely just sentences of either chastisement or mercy.  D. Andrew Byler ""Does not He who ways the heart perceive [sin], and will He not judge men according to their works?"" - Proverbs 24.12 "

There is a paragraph in the New Testament which in my opinion, clearly makes a positive inference to reincarnation.

I wrote that human brains ""are infested with sin"", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.  In reply, Mr Boundary wrote:  > I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience > can be trusted virtually ALL the time.  Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your conscience is properly formed?  The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.  Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is `properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)   Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:  > Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the > infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church, > Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.  The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation? How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?  You write:  > Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our > competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our > ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas > not subject to the experimental method.  But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way from `confident'.  This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain (really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that you are confident, that invites people to ask why.  Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any idea of his own fallibility.   I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible. The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.   Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu  [This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that -- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell, and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's some chance I'm wrong.  Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger. If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what I think is the truth.  --clh] "
soc.religion.christian	" From: jhpb@sarto.budd-lake.nj.us (Joseph H. Buehler) Subject: Re: SSPX schism ? Organization: none Lines: 240  Larry L. Overacker writes, responding to Simon:  I may be interesting to see some brief selections posted to the net.  My understanding is that SSPX does not consider ITSELF in schism or legitimately excommunicated.  But that's really beside the point.  What does the Roman Catholic church say? Excommunication can be real apart from formal excommunication, as provided for in canon law.  Here's some of the theology involved for the interested.  There is confusion over this issue of the SSPX's ""schism""; often the basic problem is lack of an ability to distinguish between:  - true obedience - false obedience - disobedience - schism  Take the various classifications of obedience first.  There are 2 important elements involved here for my purposes:  1) a command 2) the response made to the command  As far as the command goes, commands can be LEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to not eat meat on Fridays.  Or they can be ILLEGITIMATE, such as the Pope ordering Catholics to worship the god Dagon when every other full moon comes around.  As far as the response to a command goes, it can be to REFUSE to do what is commanded, or to COMPLY.  Making a table, there are thus 4 possibilites:  command         response            name ----------------------------------------------------- LEGITIMATE      COMPLY              true obedience ILLEGITIMATE    REFUSE              true obedience LEGITIMATE      REFUSE              disobedience ILLEGITIMATE    COMPLY              false obedience  So now you see where my 3 classifications of obedience come from.  Obedience is not solely a matter of compliance/refusal.  The nature of the commands must also be taken into account; it is not enough to consider someone's compliance or refusal and then say whether they are ""obedient"" or ""disobedient"".  You also have to take into consideration whether the commands are good or bad.  In my example, if the Pope commands all Catholics to worship the god Dagon, and they all refuse, they aren't being disobedient at all!  As far as the Society of Saint Pius X goes, they are certainly refusing to comply with certain things the Pope desires.  But that alone is insufficient to allow one to label them ""disobedient"".  You also have to consider the nature of the Papal desires.  And there's the rub: SSPX says the Popes since Vatican II have been commanding certain very bad things for the Church.  The Popes have of course disagreed.  So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?  Well, the only way to answer that is to examine who is saying what, and what the traditional teaching of the Church is.  The problem here is that very few Catholics have much of an idea of what is really going on, and what the issues are.  The religion of American Catholics is especially defective in intellectual depth.  You will never read about the issues being discussed in the Catholic press in this country.  (On the other hand, one Italian Catholic magazine I get -- 30 Days -- has had interviews with the Superior General of the Society of Saint Pius X.)  Many Catholics will decide to side with the Pope.  There is some soundness in this, because the Papacy is infallible, so eventually some Pope *will* straighten all this out.  But, on the other hand, there is also unsoundness in this, in that, in the short term, the Popes may indeed be wrong, and such Catholics are doing nothing to help the situation by obeying them where they're wrong.  In fact, if the situation is grave enough, they sin in obeying him.  At the very least, they're wasting a great opportunity, because they are failing to love Christ in a heroic way at the very time that He needs this badly.  Schism... let's move on to schism.  What is it?  Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate command).  All schismatics are disobedient.  But it's a superset, so it doesn't work the other way around: not all disobeyers are schismatics.  The mere fact that the SSPX priests don't comply with the Holy Father's desires doesn't make them schismatics.  So what is it that must be added to disobedience to constitute a schism?  Maybe this something else makes the SSPX priests schismatics.  You must add this: the rejection of the right to command.  Look in any decent reference on Catholic theology, and that's what you'll find: the distinguishing criterion of schism is rejection of the right to command.  Here's what the Catholic Encyclopedia says, for example:  ... not every disobedience is a schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the trangression of the commands of superiors, denial of their Divine right to command. (from the CE article ""Schism"")  Is the Society of Saint Pius X then schismatic?  The answer is a clear no: they say that the Pope is their boss.  They pray for him every day.  And that's all that matters as far as schism goes.  What all this boils down to is this: if we leave aside the consideration of the exact nature of their objections, their position is a legitimate one, as far as the Catholic theology of obedience and schism goes.  They are resisting certain Papal policies because they think that they are clearly contrary to the traditional teaching of the Papacy, and the best interests of the Church.  (In fact, someone who finds himself in this situation has a *duty* to resist.)  Now, what is the stance of Rome on all this?  Well, if you read the Holy Father's motu proprio ""Ecclesia Dei"", you can find out.  It's the definitive document on the subject.  A motu proprio is a specifically Papal act.  It's not the product of a Roman congregation, a letter that the Pope has possibly never even read.  It's from the Pope himself.  His boss is God... there's no one else to complain to.  In this document, the Holy Father says, among other things:  1) The episcopal consecrations performed by Archbishop Lefebvre constituted a schismatic act.  2) Archbishop Lefebvre's problem was a misunderstanding of the nature of Tradtion.  Both are confusing: I fail to see the logic of the Pope's points.  As far as the episcopal consecrations go, I read an interesting article in a translation of the Italian magazine ""Si Si No No"".  It all gets back to the question of jurisdiction.  If episcopal consecrations imply rejection of the Pope's jurisdiction, then they would truly constitute a schismatic act, justifying excommunication under the current code of canon law.  But my problem with this is this: according to the traditional theology of Holy Orders, episcopal consecration does not confer jurisdiction.  It only confers the power of Order: the ability to confect the Sacraments.  Jurisdiction must be conferred by someone else with the power to confer it (such as the Pope).  The Society bishops, knowing the traditional theology quite well, take great pains to avoid any pretence of jurisdiction over anyone.  They simply confer those Sacraments that require a bishop.  The ""Si Si No No"" article was interesting in that it posited that the reason that the Pope said what he did is that he has a novel, post-Vatican II idea of Holy Orders.  According to this idea, episcopal consecration *does* confer jurisdiction.  I lent the article to a friend, unfortunately, so can't tell you more.  I believe they quoted the new code of canon law in support of this idea.  The Pope's thinking on this point remains a great puzzle to me. There's no way there is a schism, according to traditional Catholic theology.  So why does the Pope think this?  As far as the points regarding the nature of Tradition goes, here's the passage in question:  The root of this schismatic act can be discerned in an incomplete and contradictory notion of Tradtion.  Incomplete, because it does not take sufficiently into the account the living character of Tradition, which, as the Second Vatican Council clearly taught,  comes from the apostles and progresses in the Church with the help of the Holy Spirit.  There is a growth in insight into the realities and words that are being passed on.  This comes about in various ways.  It comes through the contemplation and study of believers who ponder these things in their hearts. It comes from the intimate sense of spiritual realities which they experience.  And it comes from the preaching of those who have received, along with their right of succession in the espiscopate, the sure charism of truth.  But especially contradictory is a notion of Tradition which opposes the universal Magisterium of the Church possessed by the Bishop of Rome and the body of bishops.  It is impossible to remain faithful to the Tradition while breaking the ecclesial bond with him to whom, in the person of the Apostle Peter, Christ himself entrusted the ministry of unity in His Church.  (Papal motu proprio ""Ecclesia Dei"", 2 July 1988)  It seems to me that the Holy Father is making two points here that can be simplified to the following:  - Vatican Council II has happened. - I am the Pope.  The argument being that either case is sufficient to prove that Archbishop Lefebvre must be wrong, because he disagrees with them. This is weak, to say the least!  It would have helped clarify things more if the Pope had addressed Archbishop Lefebvre's concerns in detail.  What is John Paul II's stand on the social Kingship of Christ, as taught by Gregory XVI, Pius IX, Leo XIII, Pius XI and Pius XII, for example?  Are we supposed to ignore what all these Popes said on the subject?  I don't know what the future will hold, but the powers that be in the SSPX are still talking with Rome and trying to straighten things out.  --------------------------------------------------------------  [Many people would prefer to call a justified refusal to obey ""justified disobedience"" or even ""obeying God rather than man"". Calling a refusal to obey obedience puts us into a sort of Alice in Wonderland world where words mean whatever we want them to mean.  Similarly, schism indicates a formal break in the church.  If the Pope says that a schism exists, it seems to me that by definition it exists.  It may be that the Pope is on the wrong side of the break, that there is no good reason for the break to exist, and that it will shortly be healed.  But how can one deny that it does in fact exist?  It seems to me that you are in grave danger of destroying the thing you are trying to reform: the power of the papacy.  What good will it do you if you become reconciled to the the Pope in the future, but in the process, you have destroyed his ability to use the tools of church discipline?  It's one thing to hold that the Pope has misused his powers, and excommunicated someone wrongly.  It's something else to say that his excommunication did not take effect, and the schism is all in his imagination.  That means that acts of church discipline are not legal tools, but acts whose validity is open to debate.  Generally it has been liberal Catholics who have had problems with the Pope. While they have often objected to church sanctions, generally they have admitted that the sanctions exist.  You are now opening the door to people simply ignoring papal decisions, claiming to be truly obeying by disobeying, and to be in communion while excommunicated. This would seem to be precisely the denial of Divine right to command that you say defines schism.  --clh] "

If, on the other hand, this is not a matter of faith, but a matter of Church law, then we should still obey as the Pope is the legal head of the church.  In other words, given the doctrine of infallibility, we have no choice but to obey.  This is a primary problem in the Church today.  What you are saying is more or less heresy.  You might call it ""infallibilism"".  It's the idea that the Pope is always right in everything he says or does. This is virtually all over the place, especially in this country.  The Pope is only infallible under certain very specific and well-defined conditions.  When these conditions are not met, he can make mistakes.  He can make *big* mistakes.  A couple historical examples come to mind.  Bishop Robert Grosseteste was perhaps the greatest product of the English Catholic Church.  At one point during his career, the reigning Pope decided to install one of his nephews in an English see.  Bishop Grosseteste said that this would happen over his dead body (though maybe not in so many words; you have to treat Popes with respect, even when they are wrong).  The problem was that this nephew would just collect the income of the see, and probably never set foot there. This would deprive the people of the see of a shepherd.  Bishop Grosseteste was quite right in what he did!  Another example is that of Pope John XXII, a Pope of the Middle Ages. He decided that souls that were saved did not enjoy the Beatific Vision until the Last Judgement.  He decided that this should be a defined doctrine of the Church.  Though he didn't quite get around to defining it.  Now there's no way this is compatible with Catholic doctrine.  The Pope's doctrine was criticised by many in the Church. He went so far as to put a number of his opponents in jail, even.  In the end, he had to admit his mistake.  Shortly before he died, he recanted.  His successor made the exact *opposite* idea a dogma of the Church.  If you consult any of the great Catholic theologians who treat of such subjects, such as St. Robert Bellarmine (a Doctor of the Church), you will find detailed discussions of whether the Pope can personally fall into heresy or schism.  The teaching of all such theologians is that the commands of a Pope must be resisted if they are to the detriment of the Catholic Faith. A Pope's authority is given for the purpose of building up the Catholic Church.  Commands in conflict with this purpose have no legal *or* moral force. "

That you have seen no evidence that there IS a God is correct - neither have I. But lack of evidence for the existence of something is in NO WAY evidence for the non-existence of something (the creationist have a similar mode of argumentation in which if they disprove evolution the establish creation). You (personally) have never seen a neutrino before, but they exist. The ""pink unicorn"" analogy breaks down and is rather naive. I have a scientific theory that explains the appearance of animal life - evolution. When I draw the conclusion that ""pink unicorns"" don't exist because I haven't seen them, this conclusion has it's foundation in observation and theory. A ""pink unicorn"", if it did exist, would be qualitatively similar to other known entities. That is to say, since there is good evidence that all life on earth has evolved from ""more primitive"" ancestors these pink unicorns would share a common anscestory with horses and zebras and such.

I have no EVIDENCE that ""'god is' is meaningful"" at ANY level. Maybe such a response as you gave just comes naturally to you because so many people try to run their own private conception of God down your throat. I, however, am not doing this. I am arguing one, and only one, thing - that to make a positive assertion about something for which there can in principle be no evidence for or against requires a leap - it requires faith. I am, as you would say, a ""theist""; however, there is a form of atheism that I can respect - but it must be founded upon honesty.    >    Benedikt  -- bob singleton bobs@thnext.mit.edu "

The Roman Empire lasted until 1453, with its transfered capital in Constantinople.  The main reason for it's fall was not so much the sack of Constantinople by the men of the 4th Crusade (who were not Christians - they had been excommunicated down to the last man after attacking the Christian city of Zara in Croatia), but rather the disastorous defeat in the battle of Mazinkert.

Reading Abraham's ``biography'' in Genesis is very instructive. He was a man beset by *lack* of faith a lot of the time (e.g. lying about Sarah being his wife on 2 occasions; trying to fulfil God's promise on God's behalf by copulating with Hagar). . . yet it seems that God didn't evaluate him on the basis of individual incidents. Abraham is listed as one of the ``heroes of faith'' in Hebrews 11. i.e., when it really came to the crunch, God declared Abraham as a man of faith. He believed God's promises.  This gives us confidence. Although real faith demonstrates itself through works, God is not going to judge us according to our success/failure in performing works.  ``Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy he saved us, through the washing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Spirit.''

We Catholics do believe that God's revealed truth that is not explicitly recorded in the Bible can be and is passed on through the Tradition of the Church. It should be noted that the Tradition of the Church, otherwise known as Sacred Tradition, is not the same as ordinary human traditions. However, we do not believe that additional truth will be revealed to the Church.  Public revelation, which is the basis of Catholic doctrine, ended with the death of St. John, the last Apostle.  Nothing new can be added.  Theologians study this revelation and can draw out implications that were not recognized previously, so that the Council of Nicea could define statements about the theology of the Trinity and the Incarnation that were not explicitly stated in the Bible and had been disputed before the council, but there was no new revelation at Nicea or at any subsequent council.  Cardinal Newman's _An Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine_, written while he was still an Anglican, is an excellent discussion of of this point.

Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode (probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be available, or you need to retrain a new team.  Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed. Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set. Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a ""standby"" mode for use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap.  Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin- stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time.  In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money), but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.  David W. @ GSFC "
sci.space	" From: jgreen@trumpet.calpoly.edu (James Thomas Green) Subject: Keeping Spacecraft on after Funding Cuts. Organization: California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo Lines: 51  Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a ""safe"" mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments ""turned off"" rather than just ""safed"".  Was it political (i.e. as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  I've heard the argument that an active but ""uncontrolled"" spacecraft causes ""radio noise.""  I find that hard to believe that this could be a problem in a properly designed ""safe"" mode. This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a (week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth. At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be prepared if necessary.  As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it, great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal. By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.  I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit, exiting the solar system, etc).  Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby, etc) should consider designing in a ""pause"" mode in case their spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could have some kind of routine written in for the post mission ""drift"" phase.  So any holes in all this?   /~~~(-: James T.

Of course He hears all your prayers. Whether you are a sinner or a saint, no questions. The real question you should be asking is: ""Does sin block OUR hearing His answer?"" And the answer to that question is a resounding YES. To paraphrase the gospel ""Many are called but few choose to listen"" and so it is with prayer.

It does not say that it deters an individual from committing a capital crime in the first place.  The true question is whether the threat of death is likely to actually stop one from murdering.  (Or commiting treason -- are there any other capital crimes anywhere in the USA?)  That is, if there were no death penalty, would its introduction deter a would-be criminal from committing her/his crime?  I doubt it.  This is only the first step.  Even if it were a strong deterrent (short of being a complete deterrent) I would reject it.  For what about the case of the innocent executed?  And even if we could eliminate this possibility, I would reject the death penalty as immoral. This makes me something of a radical on the issue, although I think there are many opponents of captial punishment who agree with me, but who find the innocent executed the strongest argument to make.  I would, if magically placed in charge, facilitate state-aided suicide for criminals who have life-sentences.  This could be a replacement for capital punishment.

I'm not trying to be contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  The ultimate question is the traditional theology of the Church.  This is the *only* thing that it is possible to resist a Pope for: his departure from the traditional doctrine of the Church.  If commands from *any* authority conflict with Tradition, the commands must be disobeyed.  My own view on this is that this conflict could only happen in a major way.  God would never allow a hair-splitting situation to develop; it would be too complex for people to figure out.  I don't view the present situation in the Church as anything extremely complicated. Run through a list of what has happened in the last 30 years in the Catholic Church, and any impartial observer will be aghast.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.  The problems stem from a general widespread ignorance of the Catholic Faith, in my opinion.  Most Catholics know about zilch about the Catholic Faith; this leaves them wide open for destruction by erring bishops.  It's basically the Reformation part II.  There is not even a question in my mind that in some respects the shards of the Catholic Church are currently being trampled upon by the Catholic hierarchy.  I could go on listing shocking things for an hour, probably.  Take the situation in Campos, Brazil, for example.  I'm reading a book on what happened there after Vatican Council II.  The bishop, Antonio de Castro-Mayer, never introduced all the changes that followed in the wake of Vatican II.  He kept the traditional Mass, the same old catechisms, etc.  He made sure the people knew their faith, the Catholic theology of obedience, what Modernism was, etc.  He innoculated the people against what was coming.  Well, one day the order came from Rome for his retirement.  It came when the Pope was sick.  Bishop de Castro-Mayer waited until the Pope recovered, then inquired whether this command was what the Pope really wanted, or something that some Liberal had commanded in his absence. The Pope confirmed the decision.  So the good bishop retired.  The injustice that followed was completely incredible.  A new bishop was installed.  He proceeded to expel most of bishop de Castro-Mayer's clergy from their churches, because they refused to celebrate the New Mass.  The new bishop would visit a parish, and celebrate a New Mass. The people would promptly walk out of the church en masse.  The bishop was *enraged* by this.  He usually resorted to enlisting the help of the secular authorities to eject the priest from the church.  The priests would just start building new churches; the people were completely behind them.  The old parishes had the New Mass, as the bishop desired -- and virtually no parishioners.  The prime motivation for all this was completely illegal, according to canon law.  No priest can be penalized in any way for saying the traditional Mass, because of legislation enacted by Pope Saint Pius V. Nor is there any obligation to say the New Mass.  During all this process, the people of Campos, not just private individuals, but including civil authorities, were constantly sending petitions and letters to Rome to do something about the new Modernist bishop.  NOTHING was ever done; no help ever arrived from Rome. Eventually 37 priests were kicked out, and about 40,000 people.  My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX don't jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that ""I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours"", that I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  If the Pope defines certain things ex cathedra, that would be the end of the controversy.  That process is all very well understood in Catholic theology, and anyone who doesn't go along with it is an instant non-Catholic.  The problem here is that people do not appreciate what is going on in the Catholic world.  If they knew the Faith, and what our bishops are doing, they would be shocked!  We sould argue from now until the Second Coming about what the ""real"" traditional teaching of the Church is.  If this were a simple matter East and West would not have been separated for over 900 years.  This isn't the case in the Catholic Church.  There is a massive body of traditional teaching.  The Popes of the last 150 years are especially relevant.  There is no question at all what the traditional doctrine is.  I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  That's heresy, more or less.  Although they have done a great job since the Reformation, the last 30 years have seen so many errors spread that it's pitiful.  Infallibility rests in the Pope, and in the Church as a whole.  In the short term, a Pope, or large sections of the Church can go astray.  In fact, that's what usually happens during a major heresy: large sections of the Church go astray.  (The Pope historically has been much more reliable.)  Everything will always come back in the long run.  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand. Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.  Yes, it would be honored.  Infallibility is infallibility.  But what is he going to define?  That the New Mass is a better expression of the Catholic Faith than the old?  That sex education in the Catholic schools is wonderful?  That all religions are wonderful except for that professed by the Popes prior to Vatican II?  It does if the command was legitimate.  SSPX does not view the Pope's commands as legitimate.  Why?  This is a VERY slippery slope.  Not really; start studying the major Catholic theologians of the last 300 years.  Everything is very well spelled out.  The West excels at critical thought, remember?  That's what Catholic theologians have been busy at for centuries. "

Now this is getting interesting!  I was raised Roman Catholic before becoming an atheist, so I have stated this Creed you quote nearly every Sunday until I was about 18.  For some reason, I always took the 'resurrection' in this statement to mean the resurrection of the soul, but I guess resurrection does strictly mean the raising of the physical body.  I have some questions on this point:  1.  I always thought that Christians believe the descent into hell was pretty much immediate, and that there are people burning in hell right now.  You seem to be implying that it will not occur until after the ""great judgement"" (which I read as meaning the proverbial Judgment Day). I was always a little confused on this point, even when I was with the church -- maybe someone can clear it up for me.  Where will my ""soul"" (which, by the way, I don't believe in) exist until that time?  2.  Will the new body I will have be created out of the same atoms that my body now is made of, or will it be built from scratch?  My physical body now is susceptible to aging, etc. -- so I guess my new body will have to be radically different in order to be immortal so it can be tortured for all eternity?  3.  Since I will have a physical body, I assume it will need a physical place to exist in -- where is this hell?  In the center of the earth? Do you think we could find it if we dig?  Mark Schnitzius schnitzi@eola.cs.ucf.edu Univ. of Central Florida  [There is not complete agreement on the details of the afterlife.  I think the most common view is that final disposition does not occur until a final judgement, which is still in the future.  In the meantime, some believe that people ""sleep"" until the final resurrection (or because God is above time, pass directly from death to the future time when the resurrection occurs), while others believe that souls have a disembodied, pre-resurrection existence until then. There are probably other alternatives that I'm omitting.  The new body is generally conceived of being implemented in a different ""technology"" than the current one, one which is not mortal. (Paul talks about the mortal being raised to immortality, and Jesus' resurrected body -- which is the first example -- clearly was not subject to the same kind of limitations as ours.)  It is assumed that there are enough similarities that people will recognize each other, but I don't think most people claim to know the details.  I don't think I'd say it's the same atoms.  I'd assume there would be some analog of a physical place, but I wouldn't expect to find it under the earth or up in the sky.  I'd suspect that it's in another dimension, outside this physical world, or whatever.  But again, we have little in the way of details.  --clh] "

The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest.

For the most up to date information on upcoming missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.  Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news frequently.   WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?  The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).  The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102, says:  ""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program) orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target in second stage.""  This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try to interpret.  1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.  2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the ""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of ""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading."" We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.  3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").  4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver complexity"").  5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").  6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.  7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east (usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember: velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction. The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.  This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top"" [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle guy.)  I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw. The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination.

If you have access to a satellite dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72 degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g. shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite for these viewers.  If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT. It's worth asking if yours doesn't.  The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions are not being covered.   AMATEUR RADIO FREQUENCIES FOR SHUTTLE MISSIONS  The following are believed to rebroadcast space shuttle mission audio:  W6FXN  - Los Angeles K6MF   - Ames Research Center, Mountain View, California WA3NAN - Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), Greenbelt, Maryland.

soc.religion.christian	" From: muirm@argon.gas.organpipe.uug.arizona.edu (maxwell c muir) Subject: Re: Homosexuality issues in Christianity Organization: University of Arizona, Tucson Lines: 75  Can someone cite Biblical references to homosexuality being immoral, other than Leviticus? So far, when I ask, around here, I get the verses from Leviticus spouted at me, but the whole rest of that book tends to be ignored by Christians (haven't seen any stonings in a _long_ time :-).  Later, Max (Bob) Muir  [The list was posted not long ago, as I recall, aside from Lev, commonly cited passages are:  the story of Sodom.  Note however that this was a homosexual rape, and there's no disagreement that that is wrong.  I take an intermediate position on this: note that Sodom is referred to elsewhere in the Bible for its sinfulness.  It doesn't seem to have been known specifically for homosexuality.  Rather, I think it was considered a cesspool of all sins. However from what we know of Jewish attitudes, homosexuality would have contributed to the horror of the action described.  (It almost seems to have been contrived to combine about as many forms of evil in one act as possible: homosexual rape of guests, who were actually angels.)  But this story is not specifically about homosexuality.  In the NT, the clear references are all from Paul's letters.  In Rom 1, there is a passage that presupposes that homosexuality is an evil. Note that the passage isn't about homosexuality -- it's about idolatry.  Homosexuality is visited on people as a punishment, or at least result, of idolatry.  There are a number of arguments over this passage.  It does not use the word ""homosexuality"", and it is referring to people who are by nature heterosexual practicing homosexuality. So it's not what I'd call an explicit teaching against all homosexuality. But it does seem to support what would be a natural assumption anyway, that Paul shares the general negative Jewish attitude towards homosexuality.  The other passages occur in lists of sins, in I Cor 6:9, and I Tim 1:10.  Unfortunately it's not entirely clear what the words used here mean.  There have been suggestions that one has a broader meaning, such as ""wanton"", and that another may be specifically ""male prostitute"".  Again, we don't have here a precise teaching about homosexuality, but it is at least weak supportive evidence that Paul shared the OT's negative judgement on homosexuality.  Jude 1:7 is sometimes cited, however it's probably not relevant.  The context in Jude involves angels.  Since those who were almost raped in Sodom were angels, it seems likely that ""strange flesh"" refers to intercourse with angels.  As you can see, the NT evidence is such that people's conclusion is determined by their approach to the Bible.  Conservatives note that the passages from Paul's letters imply that he accepted the OT prohibition.  This is enough for them to regard it as having NT endorsement.  Liberals note that there's no specific teaching, and no clear definition of what is being prohibited or why (is the concern in Rom 1 the connection of homosexuality to pagan worship?  what exactly do the words in the lists of sins mean?).  Thus some believe it is legitimate to regard this as a attitude Paul took with him from his background and not a specific teaching of the Gospel.  This is an explosive topic, which tends to result in long dissertations on the exact meaning of various Greek words.  But it's clear to me that that's mostly irrelevant.  What it really comes down to is whether people are looking to the Bible for law or whether they believe that such as approach is inconsistent with the Gospel.  This appears to depend upon one's reaction to the message of the Bible as a whole, as well as one's perception of the needs of the church today. This is a difference of approach at least as serious as the difference between Protestant and Catholic in the 16th Cent, and one where both sides believe that the Bible is so obviously on their side that they keep thinking all they have to do is quote a few more passages and the other side will finally come to their senses.  That makes things very frustrating for a moderator, who realizes that such an optimistic outcome is not very likely...  --clh] "

I don't know if this is believeing blindly or not. I'm not sure how blindness comes into it. I do not deny reason, indeed I insist upon it, but reason only draws conclusions from evidence. If you decide in advance that your reason will act only on the evidence of the five physical senses, then you cut reason off from any possibility of reaching a conclusion outside the physical sphere (beyond the rather provocative, if inconclusive, conclusion that the physical sphere is not self explanatory).  Christians claim that they have received a different kind of evidence, which they call faith, and which is a gift of God. That is, this evidence is the evidence of a thing which chooses to reveal or hide itself. The evidence of the senses cannot tell you is such a ting exists. Reasoning on the evidence of the senses won't help either. But Christians do reason of the evidence of faith, and do claim that this evidence is wholly consistent with the evidence of the other senses, and indeed, that the evidence of these other senses is part of God's revelation of himself to us.  It is not necessarilly the case however that knowledge of a God must come through this route. There may be other senses than the physical ones providing evidence of non-physical realities. (There may, of course, be physical realities of a type for which we have no corresponding senses, for all we know.) These senses, if they exist, may provide valid evidence for reason to work on. And, as with all senses, these senses may be impaired in some people, that is, they may be spiritually blind. In this sense, belief in God becomes an act of sight, and it is disbelief which is blind.  >You are right that science and reason cannot PROVE anything.  However, if >we do not use them we can only then believe on FAITH alone.  And since >we can only use faith, why is one picture of ""God"" (e.g. Hinduism) any less >valid than another (e.g. Christianity)? > Faith, as I have said, is not opposed to reason, it is simply a new source of evidence on which reason may operate. It is clear that human beings have many systems for explaining the evidence of the physical senses, and similarly there are many systems for explaining the evidence provided by faith. Religious believers in general, and Christians in particular, use reason to help sift through the evidence to come to a clearer understanding of the evidence provided by faith. Science claims, with good reason, to be the most valid system for explaining the physical universe, and Christianity claims, also with good reason, to be the most valid system, possessed of the best evidence, for explaining Gods revelations of himself to man.  If you doubt that Christians use reason, read this newsgroup for a while and you will see rational debate aplenty. -- ============================================================================== Mark Baker                  | ""The task ... is not to cut down jungles, but aa888@Freenet.carleton.ca   | to irrigate deserts."" -- C.

Why are only those people in favor of the system to blame.  If society accepts such a system, then each member of society is to blame when an innocent person gets executed.  Those that are not in favor should work to convince others.  And, most members of our society have accepted the blame--they've considered the risk to be acceptable.  Similarly, every person who drives must accept the blame for fatal traffic accidents.  This is something that is surely going to happen when so many people are driving.

Moreover the Buddha says that we are > intrinsically good (as against Christ's ""we are all sinners"").  I never thought of these two ideas being ""against"" each other. People might quibble about what ""intrinsically"" means but the reason we are sinners is because we do not behave as good as we are. The message of Christ is that each of us are not only good, but great, that we can approach perfection, albeit perhaps through a different technique than you claim Buddhism teaches. Because we do not realize our greatness, we sin. Peter had no problem walking on water until a little doubt crept in.  Doesn't David ask in the 8th Psalm ""what is man that you [God] should care for him, but you have made him just a little lower than the angels""?  I probably exagerate in my mind what a scrawny little kid David was, just as I probably exagerate what a gigantic monster Goliath was, but David's power easily defeated Goliath's.  Remember the rich young man who comes up to Jesus and asks what he can do to enter the Kingdom, Jesus says follow the commandments. I always picture the smug look on his face as he says he's done that his whole life, probably anticipating an ""attaboy"" from the Messiah. Instead Jesus gives him a harder task, sell everything and follow Him. Jesus is raising the bar. The desciples say how can anyone do this if it's so hard even for rich people. Jesus says anyone can do it, with God's help.  Jesus says not only can we avoid killing people, we can avoid getting angry at people. Not only can we avoid committing adultery, we can control our own desires.

Your point about how ""hard"" other religions are is a good one, just as your ""Parting Question"" is a tough question. I think that Muslims worship the same God as I do, we can learn from their name ""submission"". Hindus and Buddhists and Taoists, etc. claim that ""God"" is impersonal. Is God personal or impersonal? I say yes, but if I think a little more my answer is whichever is greater. I think it is greater to be a personal entity, with an individual consciousness, but you're right that that might be a cultural bias. If I think more I must admit that God's personal nature is as far beyond my conception as His impersonal nature is beyond the Hindu's conception. If somehow Jesus could fit into Hindu cosmology then maybe I wouldn't have a problem, though that is hard to imagine.

But then, men killing women is nothing new. Islamic Fundamentalists just have a ""better"" excuse (Qu'ran).  from the Vancouver Sun, Thursday, October 4, 1990 by John Davidson, Canadian Press  MONTREAL-- Perhaps it's the letter to the five-year old daughter that shocks the most.  ""I hope one day you will be old enough to understand what happened to your parents,"" wrote Patrick Prevost. ""I loved your mother with a passion that went as far as hatred.""  Police found the piece of paper near Prevost's body in his apartment in northeast Montreal.  They say the 39-year-old mechanic committed suicide after killing his wife, Jocelyne Parent, 31.  The couple had been separated for a month and the woman had gone to his apartment to talk about getting some more money for food. A violent quarrel broke out and Prevost attacked his wife with a kitchen knife, cutting her throat, police said.  She was only the latest of 13 women slain by a husband or lover in Quebec in the last five weeks.  Five children have also been slain as a result of the same domestic ""battles.""  Last year in Quebec alone, 29 [women] were slain by their husbands. That was more than one-third of such cases across Canada, according to statistics from the Canadian Centre for Justice. [rest of article ommited]  Then to say that women are somehow ""better"" or ""should"" be the one to ""stay home"" and raise a child is also laughable. Women have traditionally done hard labor to support a family, often more than men in many cultures, throughout history. Seems to me it takes at least two adults to raise a child, and that BOTH should stay home to do so!  --- Maximus 2.01wb "

If it's bad to have 2 sets of laws, how can there be a ceremonial law that is different from the moral law (and vice versa)?  I would also be interested in your comments on the passage in I Cor. 10:1-16, where Paul teaches different rules for covering you head while praying depending on whether you are a man or a woman.  Do you think the apostles can prescribe different sets of rules for men and women?  If so, then why not for Jews and Gentiles?

Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor activity in the global scope of things.  Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink, and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.  We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few centuries, if not much longer.  Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument. The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little ultimate profit either.

D1).  I thought I'd post it to stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by saying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""What's New"" - the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mind children"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do *now*.  Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...   SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW  Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)  At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis.  The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion -dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards.  Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy.  To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.  .....  Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion to build space station Freedom alone.  Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains, Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much.  Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar space budgets.  Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  ......  While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions its competitiveness agenda.  ......  ""I wish this had happened 10 years ago instead of starting to happen now,"" says Bruce Murray, a Caltech professor who ran NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena.  ""We've put off a lot of things we shouldn't have.... I would rather see a $10-billion NASA doing well than a $40-billion one filled with white elephants."" "

Analogies can only push an argument so far (on both sides).  Both Melinda's and yours assume the premises used to set up your respective analogies are true and thus the correct conclusion will arise.  The important point to note is the different directions both sides come from. Christians believe they know the TRUTH and thus believe they have the right (and duty) to tell the TRUTH to all.  Christians can get offended if others do not believe (what is self-evidently to them) the TRUTH. Non-christians do not believe this is the TRUTH and get offended at them because they (christians) claim to know the TRUTH.  (BTW this argument goes for anyone, I am not just bagging christians)  Neither side can be really reconciled unless one of the parties changes their mind.  As Melinda pointed out, there is no point in arguing along these lines because both approach from a different premise.  A more useful line of discussion is WHY people believe in particular faiths.

How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild >idea"" stage or does it have real funding?  Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:  SPACE ADVERTISING First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the (very prominent) logos on its side of - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher) - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite) - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and - the GPS/Navstar program office This has not been considered ""paid advertising"" but rather ""public relations"", since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is ""advertising"" as much as it is ""public relations"", in my opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...] There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload bay.  These ventures would be different than ""public relations"", in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it.)  ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about 1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly, Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the British visiting cosmonaut to Mir. Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie ""The Last Action Hero"".  Besides the usual logos of the participating organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in Space News magazine a couple of months ago. (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it ""would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and receiving compensation.""   This is being disputed, since the launch is a ""commercial launch"" and NASA is receiving none of the advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is coming from NASA.)  ORBITAL ""BILLBOARDS"" Orbital ""billboards"" have been the staple of science fiction for some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert Heinlein described another in ""The Man Who Sold the Moon"".  Several different potential projects have been developed, although none have been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the ""Eiffel II"" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

How would a man of 7th Century Arabia have known >what *not to include* in the Holy Qur'an (assuming he had authored >it)?  This book is worth a read to get a sensible view of this issue.   The book is in two sections.  Section 1 contains a fairly reasonable analysis of the Bible, showing many inconsistencies between the Bible and modern science.  Well we all know that, no surprises.  Section 2 analyses the Koran's version of the Old Testament stories, and seems, on the face of it, to present a good case showing the Koran is consistent with modern science.  However, it was plain to me, that this consistency was only possible by the vague phraseology of the Koran.  Take the flood, for example, the bible is full of detail, (""forty days and forty nights"", ""pair of every animal"", etc.), we all know this is nonsense.  The Koran's description of the same event is so obscure as to make possible an interpretation such as ""A big river flooded for a few days and caused much damage"".  Yes, no contradiction but also not much fact.  The Koran might be consistent with modern science, but being consistent due to its vagueness compared with other books of that time, does not seem much of an achievement.  The book concludes by saying something like, the Koran must have had divine inspiration because at the time it was written there were a lot of (to us now) ridiculous ideas about the universe, and none of them can be found in the Koran!  Arguing for the greatness of a book by talking about what it does not contain seems absurd in the extreme.  The above is, of course, from memory so I may have missed some points.    --  Leonard               e-mail:  L.Newnham@bradford.ac.uk "

Some of what I would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time - none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men. Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife.  The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe. But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky.  Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels (or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect.  But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high. If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved.  Regards, Wm. Hathaway Baltimore MD "

This argument of yours regarding the certainty of an observation or a conclusion is not necessarily substantiated by experience.  It reminds me of the theoretical physicist who said that you can never be certain of a measurment because the sensor interferes with the field you are trying to measure.  Now, the experimental physicist will reply that although the measurement can never be made with absolute certainty, he is able to determine the certainty with which the measurement can be made, and this knowledge is often sufficient to render the measurement useful enough to allow evidence of the true condition of the field under observation. Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas not subject to the experimental method.  ?Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu ?""If any substantial number of  [ talk.religion.misc ]  readers read some ?

The church is to last for all time. However, there are those who use the church to bolster themselves.  This is evident in many letters.  For instance, Paul talks about the ""super-apostles"" to the Corinthians (2 Corinthians 11-12), he mentions how people will be led away by miracles, signs, and wonders (2 Thessalonians 2:9-12), he tells Timothy that it is clear that some will abandon the faith and teach lies (1 Timothy 4:1-3) and that some will search for teachers to suit what they want to hear (2 Timothy 4:3-4). Such passages go throughout the letters and Jesus does warn about them (Matthew 24:4-14).  But look at the promise in this last part.  Verse 14:  ""And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.""  Even today, there are false teachings.  I can name two which I am well familiar with:  the non-need of baptism and the ""praying of Jesus into your life for salvation"".  Both are taught.  Both are DEAD wrong.  They have been taken out of context from some verses, interpreted from others, and just plain made up.  The ONLY way Jesus taught is given in Luke 9:23-26 and Luke 14:25-33.  He then commands baptism in Matthew 28:18-20.  The church Jesus founded, though, is alive and well.  It's not being persecuted as much as back then (the laws won't allow it yet), but it is being persecuted.

Space Science Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting. Here goes :  The Microlight Solar Sail -------------------------  1. Introduction The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.  However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.  2.Design Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.  The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.  3.Missions The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example: a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit rate. b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base, BTW] c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300 deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating container.

Koberg,  Just a couple of minor corrections here...  1)  The Churches of Christ do not usually believe in speaking in tongues, in fact many of them are known for being strongly opposed to Pentecostal teaching.  You are probably thinking of Church of God in Christ, the largest African-American Pentecostal denomination.  2)  I'm not sure what you mean by ""signifying believers""  but it should be pointed out that the Assemblies of God does not now, nor has it ever, held that speaking in tongues is the sign that one is a Christian. The doctrine that traditional Pentecostals (including the A/G) maintain is that speaking in tongues is the sign of a second experience after becoming a Christian in which one is ""Baptized in the Holy Spirit""  That may be what you were referring to, but I point this out because Pentecostals are frequently labeled as believing that you have to speak in tongues in order to be a Christian.  Such a position is only held by some groups and not the majority of Pentecostals.   Many Pentecostals will quote the passage in Mark 16 about ""these signs following them that believe"" but they generally do not interpret this as meaning if you don't pactice the signs you aren't ""saved"".  3)  I know it's hard to summarize the beliefs of a movement that has such diversity, but I think you've made some pretty big generalizations here.  Do ""Neo-Pentecostals"" only believe in tongues as a sign and tongues as prayer but NOT tongues as revelatory with a message? I've never heard of that before.  In fact I would have characterized them as believing the same as Pentecostals except less likely to see tongues as a sign of Spirit Baptism.  Also, while neo-Pentecostals may not be inclined to speak in tongues in the non-Pentecostal churches they attend, they do have their own meetings and, in many cases, a whole church will be charismatic.

Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to eliminate designs that can't be built today.

Now many of you think that this is a joke, but I have it on good authority that just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace companies have learned that everyone yelling similar but different things ends up in many programs that do nothing much and get canceled (NASP, NLS, ALS, DCY?, etc...)  They need to work more in the japaneese, and european spirit of initial cooperation.

soc.religion.christian	" From: vek@allegra.att.com (Van Kelly) Subject: Re: Prayer in Jesus' Name Organization: AT&T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, NJ, USA Lines: 39  According to what I have read on Biblical idioms, speaking ""in X's name"" is a standard Aramaic/Hebrew legal idiom for what we today would call Power of Attorney.  A person from Jesus' culture authorized to conduct business ""in John's name"" had full authority over John's financial affairs, but was held under a solemn fiduciary obligation to work only for John's benefit and consonant with John's wishes.  It was not required for the steward to preface each business transaction with ""in John's name""; it was sufficient to have valid power of attorney and be operating in good faith. (Note the overlap here between legal and religious definitions of ""faith"".)  With this cultural background, praying ""in Jesus' name"" does not mandate a particular verbal formula; rather it requires that the petitioner be operating faithfully and consciously within an analogous ""fiduciary"" relationship with Jesus and for the purposes of His Kingdom.  The message of ""praying in Jesus' name"" is thus closely aligned with the parable of the talents and other passages about God's delegation of Kingdom business to his stewards, both resources and responsibilities.  This idea of praying ""in Jesus' name"" is not only present but prominent in the Lord's Prayer, although the verbal forumula is absent.  The act of praying the words ""In Jesus' Name"" may be beneficial if they cause us to clarify the relationship of our requests to the advancement of God's Kingdom.  For that reason, I'm not quite ready to say that the praying the formula is without meaning.  Prayers to God for other purposes (desperation, anger, thanksgiving, etc.) don't seem to be in this category at all, whether uttered by Christian or non-Christian, whether B.C. or A.D. (that's B.C.E. or C.E. for you P.C. :-).  I don't see anything in Christ's words to contradict the idea that God deals with all prayers according to His omniscience and grace.

Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the tanks big enough.  Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and flip the payload around to look at the Sun.  We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.  This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people.

sci.space	 From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder) Subject: Re: Elevator to the top floor Organization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL Lines: 56   Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in, therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft, or 75 Statute miles.  Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength. Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column.  A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.  The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area, although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support.  Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites, assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity, but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.  This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind loads.  These will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor.

soc.religion.christian	 From: bfinnert@chaph.usc.edu (Brian Finnerty) Subject: Mary's assumption Organization: University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA Lines: 34  A few points about Mary's being taken into heaven at the end of her life on earth:  One piece of evidence for Mary's assumption into heaven is the fact that no Christian church ever claimed to be the sight where she was buried. Some Christian churches claimed to be located at the final resting places of Peter, Mark, and other saints, but no one ever claimed to possess the body of Mary, the greatest of the saints. Why? Because everyone knew that she had been taken up into heaven.  Although there is no definitive scriptural proof for the assumption of Mary, some passages seem suggestive, like the passage in Revelation that describes a woman giving birth to a Son and later being crowned in the heavens. Of course, the woman in this passage has other interpretations; she can also be taken a symbol for the Church.  The assumption of Mary makes sense because of her relationship to Christ.  Jesus, perfect God and perfect man, fulfilled the requirements of the law perfectly.  Under the law God gave to us, we are to honor our mother and father, and Christ's act of taking his mother into heaven is part of his fulfillment of that law. Also, he took his flesh from her, so it seems appropriate that he decide not to allow her flesh to rot in the grave.  One last point: an ex-Catholic attempted to explain Catholic doctrine on the assumption by asserting it is connected to a belief that Mary did not die. This is not a correct summary of what Catholics believe. The dogma of the assumption was carefully phrased to avoid saying whether Mary did or did not die. In fact, the consensus among Catholic theologians seems to be that Mary in fact did die. This would make sense: Christ died, and his Mother, who waited at the foot of the cross, would want to share in his death.  Brian Finnerty

Lines: 125  Heres the life of St. MAria Goretti, posted with kind permission of the editor of the Australian Catholic Magazine ""Morning Star"".  Hope you like it.  Put up with anything to prevent sin St. Maria Goretti    Maria was born on October 16th 1890 to Luigi and Assunta Goretti, the  eldest  daughter  in the family of seven. She was a cheerful girl, always imitating her parents.  She had but one disire,  but one wish: to receive our Lord in the Blessed Sacrament.  The date was finally set for little Maria to receive our Lord  on the feast of Corpus Christi. For Maria, time seemed like an eter- nity as she  slowly  neared  the  great  day.   When  it  finally arrived, Fr. Jerome( the priest who was to celebrate the Mass and give the children their First Holy Communion) delivered a  sermon on	the  immense love of Jesus Christ for them and the great love we should have in return for Him. He then warmly  urged  them  to die rather than commit a mortal sin.  Maria humbly approached the Altar of God and  received  the  Holy Eucharist.	Her  only  sadness  was  the  thought of her father's absence, who died some time beforehand. As for the	rest  of  the day,  Maria remained under the spell of the divine visit; that is until  -4-        her thoughts changed to when she could go next to Holy Communion. Thus ended the happiest day of Maria's life.  Over the next twelve months, Maria had changed  from  a  giggling little girl into a quiet young lady with responsibilities. As her mother went out into the fields in place of  her  husband,	Maria took  on the ironing, cooking, washing and other motherly duties. She was doing this not only for her own family, but also for  the Serenellis, a father and son who lived with the Goretti's, owning a share in the farm. Although Maria was poorer than all the other children, she by far surpassed them in virtue. In all thi ngs she did the Holy Will of God.  During the month of June,  Alessandro  Serenelli(the  son)	twice made advances upon Maria when he chanced to be alone with her. On both occasions Maria managed to  struggle  free  of  Alessandro's strong  grip, but on the second, he threatened to kill her if she even uttered a word to her mother. From this day on, Maria	lived in terror, fearing lest Alessandro attack again.   On July 5th 1902, Alessandro left work in the fields  to  ""get  a handkerchief,""  as	he  claimed. He went to the storeroom beneath the house where Maria, who was outside on the  landing  with  the baby,  could  hear him fumbling about in with tools. She wondered what he was doing. It was later learned that he was sharpening  a 91/2""  blade. He went to the house and called for Maria. She told him she wouldn't go to him unless she knew why she was needed. He stormed out to the landing and dragged her up to her room. Mar ia instantly realized what he was up to. ""No, No, No! Do  not	touch me!  It  is a sin, you will go to Hell!"" At this point Alessandro held the knife over Maria's chest, who was now on the floor.  ""Will you or will you not?"" Maria gathered all her energy.	""No I will  not,	Alessandro,  no!""   She had chosen her martyrdom over sin, God over Satan.  Overcome with rage, Alessandro plunged  the knife  into   Maria's  breast fourteen times.  Finally he came to his senses and thought Maria was dead.  Frantically he threw  the knife behind a closet and locked himself in his room.  The crying of the baby Teresa	on  the  landing  brought  the	attention  to Assunta  and the father of Alessandro. As the baby was unattended and was in danger of falling off, they ran to the house  to  find Maria,  who,  covered in blood, was dragging herself to the door. When asked what happened she said Alessandro  stabbed  her.   ""He wanted to make me do wrong and I would not.""  The ambulance arrived, then the police who took Alessandro	away. As	the  ambulance	carried  Maria to the hospital, a large crowd followed on foot.  The doctors at the  hospital held no hope  for poor  little Maria.  The same Fr. Jerome who gave Maria her First Communion  -5-        came to administer the last rites and to give her Holy  Viaticum. He asked Maria if she would forgive her murderer.  ""Yes.  For the love of Jesus I forgive him.  I wish for him to one day  join  me in	Paradise.   May  God forgive him, for I alread y have."" Maria died at about three o'clock.  Alessandro was tried  and  found  guilty  of  Maria's  death  but because  of  his  age  he  was  sentenced to only thirty years in prison.  After eight  years of being a violent prisoner and show- ing  no regret for his crime, he saw in a dream, in the  midst of a field of flowers, Maria holding out a bunch of white lilies  to him.  Soon later he wrote to the local bishop, begging God's par- don for the grave sin he had committed.  He later gave  testimony in	Maria's  beatification in 1947.  Less than three years later, on Ju ne 24th 1950, Maria was canonised.  Assunta Goretti was the first mother ever to be present at her daughter's canonisation.  May St. Maria Goretti help	us  to	be  pure  and  grant  us  the strength to die rather than commit a mortal sin.

It's use as prayer language seems especially troubling to me.  I understand that when you pray in tongues, the spirit is doing the talking.  And when you pray, you pray to God.  And the Spirit is God.  So, the Spirit is talking to Himself.  Which is why I only go by the Pentecost use where it's an actual language.  Moreover, the phrase ""though I speak with the tongues of men and angels"" used by Paul in I Cor. is misleading out of context.   Some would then assume that there is some angelic tongue, and if when they speak, it is no KNOWN language, then it is an angelic tongue.  Hmmm...in the old testament story about the tower of Babel, we see how God PUNISHED by giving us different language.  Can we assume then that if angels have their own language at all, that they have the SAME one amongst other angels?  After all, THEY were not punished in any manner.  So why do these supposed angelic tongues all sound different FROM ONE ANOTHER?  It's disturbing to think that some people find ways to justify jabbering.  But I'll buy the idea that someone could talk in a language never learned.  Trouble is, while such stories abound, any and all attempts at verification (and we are to test the spirit...) either show that the witness had no real idea of the circumstances, or that outright fabrication was involved.  The Brother Puka story in a previous post seems like a ""friend of a friend"" thing.  And linguistically, a two syllable word hardly qualifies as language, inflection or no.  Much as many faith healers have trouble proving their ""victories"" (since most ailments ""cured"" are just plain unprovable) and modern day ressurrections have never been validated, so is it true that no modern day xenoglossolalia has been proved by clergy OR lay.

sci.space	 From: eder@hsvaic.boeing.com (Dani Eder) Subject: Re: Guns for Space Keywords: Sopa Gun, Space Launcer Organization: Boeing AI Center, Huntsville, AL Lines: 72   Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun. The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building, and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls) from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience.  I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun. At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work, but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),  The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe). The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres.  The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi. The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long.  All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile.  The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing, the projectile vaporizes.  The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB to follow the projectiles.  The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s, and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).  There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12= 4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.  This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful- sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit.

[remainder of message deleted]  Pardon me for replying to only a portion of your message :)  The reason we can say ""God just exists"" and can't say ""The universe just exists"" is because the universe is a natural realm and is subject to natural laws in general and the law of cause and effect in particular.  That is, we observe in nature that every cause has an effect, and every effect was produced by a cause.  The existence of the natural realm, as an effect itself, cannot be its own cause; it must therefore have a supernatural cause.  God, on the other hand, is a supernatural being, and is therefore not subject to such natural laws as the law of cause and effect.  As a supernatural being, God's eternal existence does not imply a previous cause the way the existence of a physical, natural cosmos does.  Thus, those who believe in the supernatural have a valid basis for accepting the existence of uncaused phenomena such as the eternal God, whereas those who deny the existence of the supernatural are faced with the dilemma of a physical universe whose very nature shows that it is not sufficient to explain its own existence.  This is, of course, an oversimplification of a complex topic, but I just wanted to clarify some important differences between the supernatural (God) and the natural (the universe), since you seem to mistake them as being interchangeable.  - Mark "

If we admit the possibility that they had lived previous >lives, and that (in accordance with the Asiatic idea of ""karma"") >their present lives are a reward or punishment for past behaviour, >this makes nonsense of Paul's whole point. >  The existence of repeated earth lives and destiny (karma) does not mean that everything that happens is predetermined by past deeds. There is an oriental view of it that tends in that direction, but I did not subscribe to that view.  God may choose one individual over another as the fit instrument for his plans, but that does not preclude that the development of that individual into what he is in this earthly life is not the result of a longer course of development.  I do not, and Rudolf Steiner did not, subscribe to the oriental view of an inexorable, mechanistic karma determining everything that befalls one.  This is a kind of shriveled caricature of a much greater law in the context of which the deed of Christ on Golgotha and the ultimate salvation and freedom of the human being as a working of Christ can be seen as the master theme and, indeed, a new impulse that was completely free of karma.  Christ incarnated only once in the flesh, and in that he had no debt of karma or sin.  The oriental concepts of reincarnation and karma, which are even more trivialized and mechanized in some new age teachings, incorrectly assume Jesus Christ to have been the reincarnation of a master.  avatar, etc. Their teaching of reincarnation and karma also has no concept the continuing individuality from one life to the next (e.g. Buddhism). More important, they have no concept of the resurrection of the body, the ultimate continuity of the whole human being -- to ultimate resurrection and judgement on the Last Day.  There is another biblical passage that also has a bearing. It is the tenth chapter of John, devoted almost entirely to the man born blind. Clearly here, Jesus tells the disciples that it was not his past karma or that of his parents that led to his blindness, but rather that a new impulse is to be revealed through him.  But note that he does not refute the disciples' question.  In fact, they ask it as a matter of course, the question being stated as if it were self evident that only one of two possibilities existed - it was either the sins of the man himself, obviously not in this incarnation, or the sins of his parents.  The fact that they even asked about the first possibility at all indicates an awareness of the idea on their part and the form of Christ's answer indicates that he did not disagree with it.  There is also Matthew 11:14, where Jesus says straight out about John the Baptist,  ""If you care to accept it, he himself is Elias, who was to come.""  This also emphasizes that the Gospels do not have a positive teaching either way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happens to the human being at all between death and the Last Day.  Even Jesus did not push this teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (""If you care to accept it"").  So I took care to point out, not that the Bible teaches reincarnation but that it does not deny it either, and that much in both scripture and fundamental Christian doctrine becomes understandable if reincarnation is understood in the right way.  I pointedly used ""repeated earth lives"" to distinguish a little from the oriental doctrines usually associated with the word ""reincarnation"". The phrase is Rudolf Steiner's (wiederholte Erdenleben).  He noted too that the idea needed to arise as a new insight in the west, completely free from eastern tradition.  It did in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the most important expression of it being Lessing's ""The Education of the Human Race"".  To return to your original point, Paul's statement about Jacob and Esau does not contradict the idea of repeated earth lives and karma. And both of these principles receive their fulfillment in the incarnation, death, and resurrection, ascension and return of Jesus Christ, in my view.

I don't know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the major problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would have to be processed.  This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust, average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound. This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.  On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11 and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but... terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are *enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2 at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being mined today).

Bomber Harris was no hero of mine.  Perhaps so.  And maybe the atomic bomb was a mistake too.  But that's easy to say from our ""enlightened"" viewpoint here in the 90's, right?  Back then, it was *all-out* war, and Germany and Japan had to be squashed. After all, a million or more British had already died, hundreds of thousands of French, a couple hundread thousand or so Americans, and millions of Russians, not to mention a few million Jews, Poles, and other people of slavic descent in German concentration camps.  All things considered, the fire-bombings and the atomic bomb were essential (and therefore justified) in bringing the war to a quick end to avoid even greater allied losses.  I, for one, don't regret it.  > >>                                 War is never an exact science, but >> with smart bombs, it's becoming more exact with a smaller percentage >> of civilian casualties.

I make no claim or effort to justify the misguided foreign policy of the West before the war.  It is evident that the West, especially America, misjudged Hussein drastically.  But once Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened to militarily corner a significant portion of the world's oil supply, he had to be stopped.  Sure the war could have been prevented by judicious and concerted effort on the part of the West before Hussein invaded Kuwait, but it is still *Hussein* who is responsible for his decision to invade.  And once he did so, a strong response from the West was required.  > >> Mathew, your sarcasm is noted but you are completely off-base here. >> You come off sounding like a complete peace-nik idiot, although I >> feel sure that was not your intent. > > What's your intent?

Isn't it funny that these days how MTV has become the ""bible"" of music and beauty these days.  MTV controls what bands are popular, no matter how bad they are.  In fact, it is better to be politically correct - like U2, Madonna - than to have any musical talent.  Then of course, you have this television station that tells us all how to dress.  Think about it, who started the retro-fashion craze??  MTV and Madonna.  Gag.  Anyway, just food for thought.  It is really my own wierd theory.  If Revelation was to come true today, I think MTV would the ""ever changing waters"" (music and fashion world) that the beast would arise from, and Madonna will be the whore of Babylon, riding the beast and drinking the blood of the martyrs.

If you do sincerely believe that a god exists, why do you follow >it blindly? >     Do the words ""Question Authority"" mean anything to you? >     I defy any theist to reply.  Dear Defiant (or Unfaithful or Pixie):  I will take up the challenge to reply, as I am a theist.  The foundation for faith in God is reason, without which the existence of God could not be proven.  That His existence can be proven by reason is indisputable (cf. my short treatise, ""Traditional Proofs for the Existence of God,"" and Summa Theologica).  Now, given that God exists, and that His existence can be proven by reason, I assert that His commands must be followed blindly, although in our fallen condition we must always have some measure of doubt about our faith.  Why?  Because God is the First Cause of all things, the First Mover of matter, the Independent Thing that requires nothing else for its existence, the Measure of all that is perfect, and the essential Being who gives order to the universe (logos).  I next assert that God is all good.  If this is so, then that which is contrary to the will of God is evil; i.e., the absence of the good.  And, since God can never contradict Himself, then by His promise of a Savior as early as the Protoevangelium of Genesis 3:5, God instructs that because a human (Adam) was first responsible for man's alienation from the Source of all good, a man would be required to act to restore the friendship. Thus God became incarnate in the person of the Messiah.  Now this Messiah claimed that He is the Truth (John 14:6).  If this claim is true, then we are bound by reason to follow Him, who is truth incarnate.  You next seem to have a problem with authority.  Have you tried the United States Marine Corps yet?  I can tell you first-hand that it is an excellent instructor in authority.  If you have not yet had the privilege, I will reply that the authority which is Truth Incarnate may never be questioned, and thus must be followed blindly.  One may NOT deny the truth.  For example, when the proverbial apple fell on Isaac Newton's head, he could have denied that it happened, but he did not.  The laws of physics must be obeyed whether a human likes them or not.  They are true.  Therefore, the Authority which is Truth may not be denied.

Before you post a text in reply investigate its context.  First of all, ""ceremonial law"" is an extraScriptural term.  It is sometimes used as a framework to view Scripture.  But if you look at Collosions, without going into it with the assumption that the Sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law, you will see that it does refer to the sabbath.  Paul writes in Collosions 2:14-17 how that Christ nailed the laws that were against us to His cross, and therefore we should not be judged in what what food we eat, what we drink, the keeping of new moons and holy days, or the keeping of the sabbath.  The word for sabbath in this verse is ""sabbaton"" and is used throughout the New Testament to refer to the 7th day.  If there is any Scripture from which we get the idea of the ceremonial law, this is one of them, and the sabbath is listed among the ceremonial laws.  If one goes into this with the fundamental assumption ""the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law"" then he will have to find some way around it, like saying that this can only refer to the other sabbath holy days besides the 7tH day, Because ""the sabbath cannot be a ceremonial law.""  But Paul is very careful in his letters to add some kind of parenthetcal statement if there is anything that can be seen as a liscence to sin in his writings.  Also, why is the sabbath absent from the epistles (except for Hebrews 4, which talks about the rest that comes through faith?)  Surely it would have been a big problem for first century Christians living in a society that did not rest on the 7th day.  Especially slaves. Many new converst were slaves.  It would have been difficult for slaves to rest on the sabbath if it had been mandatory.  Why is there no mention of this in the epistles?  Link Hudson. "

soc.religion.christian	" From: halsall@murray.fordham.edu (Paul Halsall) Subject: Catholic Liturgy Reply-To: halsall@murray.fordham.edu Organization: J. Random Misconfigured Site Lines: 60   The problems with Catholic liturgy are likely to continue for some time.  The problem is, in a nutshell, this: the Liturgy is a symbolic action - in other words Catholics do [or should] believe that the _signs_ during the mass - Water, Blessings, Vestments, Altar, Relics, etc - are real. That is the sprinkling of water bestows real, almost tangible, holiness, the Vestments are a real indication of real sacred time. The point of a _symbol_ is that it is understood by all to be connected to an underlying REAL referent. This kind of thinking precludes analysis; holy water is not holy because of anything, it simply IS holy.  But, modern westerners find it extremely difficult, especially if well- educated, to think of the mass as a symbol. We are more likely to see it as a _sign_, ie an action that represents grace, but which could be replaced with other signs. In concrete terms, this means the mass has become a commercial for God's grace rather than the real thing. You can mess around with a commercial in a way you wouldn't dare with the real thing [ask Coca-Cola Co.!]. These attitudes have been encouraged by Liturgy workshops, etc. which instead of focusing on _how_ to do do liturgy, have focused on how to create a meaning in liturgy. You can only create signs, symbols have to come from God [or the heart, or somewhere deeper than analysis. The most dramatic example of this shift in understanding has been in the treatment of the sacred species [the consecrated host and wine]. Now, with pita bread etc, it is common to come away from the altar with hands covered in particles. If the Host is a sign of Grace, this isnt and issue; but Catholics in the past would have been distraught at this real desacration of the real symbol of Jesus' body.  Modern Catholic liturgy  is caught in this epistemological shift. We try to perfrom the old rites, but then we have some liturgomaniac priest get up and 'explain' what we are doing - so we stop doing it and start pretending to do it. This is not a soul filling experience. It doesn't help BTW that we have got stuck witha huge amount of two and three chord ersatz-folk music [again a result of mis-analysis: complicated tunes are in fact easier to remember than simple ones - this was the genius of Wesley and the 19C Anglican hymn writers]. Taize' is only slightly better.  What are we to do? Well I suggest rejecting the parish system if it doesn't work for you. Search out a Church where the liturgy is well prepared not well-explained. They exist in every city. This is not BTW a matter of particular style: the music might be old or new. It is the attitude of the church that counts. Also, note that a conservative liturgy - harking back to pre-Vatican II days, does not necessarily mean the Church will be socially conservative.  In NYC I can recommend: Corpus Christi - W 12st St. Corpus Christi - W 12st St. - very conservative liturgy, St. Joseph's, Greenwich Village.  - Modern, ""clean"", largely gay Oratorian Church, Brooklyn - Very beautiful  Avoid, anywhere, anytime a church with electric candles.

Preliminary analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation index is near the optimal level.  7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument. Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.  8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.  9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads 19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.  10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:  a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading) e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1 f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within acceptable range g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS, EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within acceptable range j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours Time To Initiation - 260 hours   GDS (Ground Data Systems):  1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21 (Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller (TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The 10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.   TRAJECTORY  As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory status was as follows:  Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU) Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU) Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds   SPECIAL TOPIC  1.  As of April 15, 1993, a total of 70184 real-time commands have been transmitted to Galileo since Launch.  Of these, 65076  were initiated in the sequence design process and 5108 initiated in the real-time command process. In the past week, 7 real time commands were transmitted: 6 were initiated in the sequence design process and one initiated in the real time command process. Major command activities included commands to reacquire celestial reference, uplink the EJ-1 sequence memory load, and reset the command loss timer. ___    _____     ___ /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | Being cynical never helps /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | to correct the situation |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | and causes more aggravation | instead.

The answer to both questions is yes.  All Scripture is true, being inspired by God.  The evidence for this claim has been discussed ad nauseum in this group.  Similarly, all truth is absolute.  Indeed, a non-absolute truth is a contradiction in terms.  When is something absolute?  When it is always true.  Obviously, if a ""truth"" is not always ""true"" then we have a contradiction in terms.  Many people claim that there are no absolutes in the world.  Such a statement is terribly self-contradictory.  Let me put it to you this way.  If there are no absolutes, shouldn't we conclude that the statement, ""There are no absolutes"" is not absolutely true?  Obviously, we have a contradiction here.  This is just one of the reasons why Christians defy the world by claiming that there are indeed absolutes in the universe.  >There is hardly consensus, even in evangelical >Christianity (not to mention the rest of Christianity) regarding >Biblical interpretation.  So?  People sometimes disagree about what is true.  This does not negate the fact, however, that there are still absolutes in the universe.  Moreover, evangelical Christianity, at least, still professes to believe in certain truths.  Man is sinful, man needs salvation, and Jesus is the propitiation for mankind's sins, to name a few.  Any group that does not profess to believe these statements cannot be accurately called evangelical.   -- Virgilio ""Dean"" Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Eng'g and Applied Physics CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee ""Bullwinkle, that man's intimidating a referee!""   |    My boss is a ""Not very well.

soc.religion.christian	" From: JJMARVIN@pucc.princeton.edu Subject: prayers and advice requested on family problem Organization: Princeton University Lines: 70  My brother has been alienated from my parents and me since shortly after his marriage to a domineering and insecure woman, about twelve years ago. We've kept things on a painfully polite, Christmas-card sort of level for most of this time. Attempts to see each other end disastrously, with his wife throwing a screaming fit and storming out over either our imagined slights to her, or his inattention or insensitivity to her (I mean, this'll happen by the end of a single restaurant meal). He seems, from what I've seen, to live in a state of quivering anxiety, hoping futilely to keep the next storm from breaking. He has sacrificed not only meaningful contact with us but also other friends and outside interests. Now, this is his choice, and I need to accept it even if I deplore it. But it's hard. From time to time I've wanted to drop the pretense that we have a relationship--by cutting off contact--or trying to have a real if painful relationship, by talking honestly with him, but I've always thought, ""Why be dramatic? And you know he'll only get evasive and then find some excuse to get off the phone. Just leave the door open, in case he ever decides to come back."" It's been an unsatisfying choice, to allow us to go on with the superficial trappings of a relationship, but it was the best I could think of. Now, this weekend, my mother finally decided that she wasn't going to pretend any more and has cut off relations with them. This was the outcome of a phone conversation in which my sister-in-law screamed and raved at my mother, blaming her for everything wrong in their lives, and in which my brother evaded, temporized, claimed the situation was beyond his control, and as always expected my mother to make all the allowances and concessions. Mom said she would not, that she would not quietly take abuse any more, and that if these were the terms of their relationship, she didn't want to talk to or see them any more. And she hung up. (I have never seem my mother lose her temper, and I think that this is the first time she's ever hung up on someone.) Mom says she feels as if she's divorced my brother, and that it's a relief in some ways to have the break out in the open and done with.  I have mixed feelings. I'm proud of Mom for sticking up for herself; angry at my brother and sister-in-law for hurting her, for being jerks, for persisting in such a wretched life, which hurts us all and is warping their children; angry at my sister-in-law for being so hateful, and angry at my brother for being a coward and having so little respect for himself or us that he's willing to throw us aside and use up all his energy trying to appease an unappeasable, emotionally disturbed woman; pained for their children, who are a mess; scared for the future, since this marks the time when either things will change and improve or the break will become irrevocable; nastily self- righteous over this bit of proof that they can't ""get away"" with treating us or each other this way, and then disgusted with myself for even beginning to gloat over others' misery; and finally, mostly, sad, sad, sad, to see my parents hurt and my brother and sister-in-law trapped in a horrible, destructive situation that they can't see a way out of--or they can't bear to take whatever paths they do see. And I'm frustrated because I don't know what if anything to do, and doing nothing drives me up the wall. I try to pray, about my own feelings of rage, impotence, and vindictiveness, and about their situation, but I am not free of the desire to *DO* something concrete. (The desire to *DO* something, to define a problem and fix it, is one of my besetting vices; I'm having a terrible time quieting down my internal mental chatter enough to listen for God.) Do you thoughtful and kind people on the net have advice for me? Is this a time to reach out to my brother? To let things be? How can I conquer my rage AT him enough to be there FOR him?  Here's the big question I've been evading throughout this long, long post: Is it ok, as a Christian and a proponent of faith, hope, and charity, to accept the destruction of a relationship? To give up on my own brother, or at least to accept that I am powerless to help him and can only wait and see what happens? Do please answer--by e-mail or post.  Thank you.

Why is it that we have this notion that God takes some sort of pleasure from punishing people?  The purpose of hell is to destroy the devil and his angels.  To the earlier poster who tried to support the eternal hell theory with the fact that the fallen angels were not destroyed, remember the Bible teaches that God has reserved them until the day of judgement.  Their judgement is soon to come.  Let me suggest this.  Maybe those who believe in the eternal hell theory should provide all the biblical evidence they can find for it.

On a tour hosted by JPL Chief Scientist Dr. Moustafa Chahine and Merle McKenzie, manager of the International Affairs Office, Hawking visited a variety of facilities, met with Lab Director Dr. Edward Stone and various project scientists and managers, and felt ""like royalty,"" he said. Hawking, whose theories attempt to explain the origin of distant galaxies, black holes and alternate dimensions, wanted to re-visit JPL, he explained, ""because while I'm most interested in those things in space that are farther away, I know that here is where the first steps are taken."" Hawking, who was accompanied by his family, two graduate students and his aides, began the tour in von Karman Auditorium, as David Evans, deputy assistant Lab director in the Office of Flight Projects, and Dr. Arden Albee, Mars Observer's project scientist, briefed him on current and past flight projects. Voyager was pointed out to him, with special attention paid to a gold plate with a series of engraved images. Should extraterrestrial life stumble upon the spacecraft, Evans noted, they would find a variety of images that would explain something of Earth. The professor asked if we were still communicating with the spacecraft, and Evans affirmed that we are. Using a model of Mars Observer, Albee spent several minutes describing the project and the spacecraft's features. In answer to a question from Hawking, Chahine described a proposed drag-free satellite, but confirmed that at this point, ""it's only a concept."" Chahine, who had met Hawking at Caltech about five years before, described the professor as ""a living miracle of the power of the brain. He's miraculous, and he has such a good sense of humor."" The next stop, a demonstration on scientific data visualization in Section 384's Digital Image Animation Lab, entertained and delighted the group, as everyone donned goggles to view 3-D images of Mars. Project Scientist Dr. Eric De Jong showed off the latest data -- a comet that had only recently been discovered in orbit close to Jupiter. Hawking was curious about its composition, and as he was shown how images are developed, he asked several questions on their interpretation. Norman Haynes, ALD, Office of Telecommunications and Data Acquisition, briefed the professor on the Space Flight Operations Facility, and then Hawking spoke with Stone. The day ended with two technical discussions of particular interest to the professor. Technical Group Leader Dr. Frank Estabrook and Senior Research Scientist Hugo Wahlquist described a three-spacecraft gravity wave experiment, currently under way. Then planetary astronomer Dr. Richard Terrile explained the philosophy and plans for extra solar system planetary detection. The Hawking party, which had been visiting Southern California for five weeks, was headquartered at Caltech, and planned to leave for England within a few weeks after the Lab tour. Upon departing, the Cambridge-based scientist promised Chahine that he would return to JPL for another visit. ### ___    _____     ___ /_ /|  /____/ \  /_ /|     Ron Baalke         | baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov | | | |  __ \ /| | | |     Jet Propulsion Lab | ___| | | | |__) |/  | | |__   M/S 525-3684 Telos | The aweto from New Zealand /___| | | |  ___/    | |/__ /| Pasadena, CA 91109 | is part caterpillar and |_____|/  |_|/       |_____|/                     | part vegetable.

sci.space	 From: games@max.u.washington.edu Subject: SSTO Senatorial (aide) breifing recollections. Article-I.D.: max.1993Apr6.125512.1 Distribution: world Lines: 78 NNTP-Posting-Host: max.u.washington.edu  The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and commercial space.  This is how it went...    After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO, I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour. Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.  We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide, who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.  Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening. We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific. Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that we brought up.  But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space. So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that. We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.  We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided in those sectors.  Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc.. We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.  We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.  We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan), and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.  In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it. He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it, and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually happen immediatly there.  The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers.  Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this would be something that she would be very interested in, although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days.  All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.  John.

Organization: Free University of Berlin, Germany Lines: 41 Cc: u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk   I've heard it said that the accounts we have of Christs life and ministry in the Gospels were actually written many years after the event. (About 40 years or so). Is this correct?? If so, why the big time delay?? I know all scripture is inspired of God, so the time of writing is I suppose un-important, but I still can't help be curious!  --------------------------------------------------- Ivan Thomas Barr  Contact me at u9126619@athmail1.causeway.qub.ac.uk  [The Gospels aren't dated, so we can only guess.  Luke's prolog is about the only thing we have from the author describing his process. The prolog sounds like Luke is from the next generation, and had to do some investigating.  There are traditions passed down verbally that say a few things about the composition of the Gospels.  There are debates about how reliable these traditions are.  They certainly don't have the status of Scripture, yet scholars tend to take some of them seriously.  One suggests that Mark was based on Peter's sermons, and was written to preserve them when Peter had died or way about to die. One tradition about Matthew suggests that a collection of Jesus words may have been made earlier than the current Gospels.  In the ancient world, it was much more common to rely on verbal transmission of information.  I think many people would have preferred to hear about Jesus directly from someone who had known him, and maybe even from someone who studied directly under such a person, rather than from a book.  Thus I suspect that the Gospels are largely from a period when these people were beginning to die.  Scholars generally do think there was some written material earlier, which was probably used as sources for the existing Gospels.  Establishing the dates is a complex and technical business.  I have to confess that I'm not sure how much reliance I'd put on the methods used.  But it's common to think that Mark was written first, around 64 AD., and that all of the Gospels were written by the end of the Century.  A few people vary this by a decade or so one way or the other.  --clh]

The emphasis is on relationships, not on programs, and both the evangelism and the discipling are relationship-based.  This will probably raise more questions than it answered, but that's it in a nutshell. -- ****************************************************************** *     Jon Reid     * He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep * * reid@cs.uiuc.edu * to gain what he cannot lose.   - Jim Elliot * ****************************************************************** "

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning beginning at 10:30 AM.  Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator testing will take place on Monday .  The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument. This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points in varying spacecraft attitudes and orientations.  Today, the spacecraft is 22,971,250 km (14,273,673 mi.) from Mars travelling at a velocity of 2.09 kilometers/second (4,677 mph) with respect to Mars.

Mckissock) Subject: Gibbons Outlines SSF Redesign Guidance News-Software: VAX/VMS VNEWS 1.41 Nntp-Posting-Host: tm0006.lerc.nasa.gov Organization: NASA Lewis Research Center / Cleveland, Ohio Lines: 76  NASA Headquarters distributed the following press release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently discussed on sci.space are covered in this.  Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance  Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space station.  A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee. Each option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development, operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.  Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA budget for the President's new technology investment. As a result, station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.  Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of the advisory committee. Generally, the members-designate focused upon administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted. They also received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory committee to consider.  Gibbons also announced that the United States and its international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.  To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology. The overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilities. Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving that goal.  Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to the redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program represents. However, he also is committed to a space station that is well managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""  NASA Administrator Daniel S. Goldin said the Russian participation will be accomplished through the East- West Space Science Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald Sagdeev.  "

Good point -- it is very true that these ""false"" predictions are dangerous--we are warned (more than once) in scripture about false prophtets.  However, as is often the case with other issues, one cannot let those who falsly report such ""visions"" as a reason against believing in any of them (I did not get the impression you were asserting this, by the way...I consider my response not so much a response to your posting but a response to the topic as a whole).  Example:  The Appearances of Mary at Fatima, Portugal in 1917.  Among other things, she predicted the conversion of Russia to Atheism (something that happened less than a year later w/ the Bolshevik revolution).  She also predicted the second world war (that is, predicte	predicted that it would occur during the papacy of a certain pope, who was not the current one.  It happened just like she said.)  She warned there would be ""fire in the sky"" as a warning that the second world war was about to start.  About a week before Germany invaded, weathermen (and women, I suppose) all over Europe, from England to Spain to Eastern Europe, reported the most spectacular reddish color in the sky ever recorded.  To this day some try to explain it off as the northern lights, and the relation to Mary's prediction simply coincidence.  You all can decide for yourselves.  Mary predicted that the Atheistic Russia would spread her evils all over the world and persecute religion.  She said many other things as well, too numerous to list here.  Every single one has been realized.  	One can only use the term ""coincidence"" so many times in the same explanation before its use becomes ridiculous.  SO...yes, there are many false prophets and many false reports. There are true ones, too.  We must always remain open to that.  Fatima was one example.  There is another one, currently occuring--the apparitions that have been taking place at Medjurgorje, Yugoslavia (or whatever its called now).  Mary has been appearing every day for eleven years now.  It's time the world started listening.  More info available to any who want it.

In order to purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be one of the following: a) An employee of a government agency. b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets. c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry. Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.  The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are: - Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. - The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft within the operating radius around the launch site. - Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited. - The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.  Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year) are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).  The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members' use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is from 50 to 500 or more feet.  By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart C, for details.  As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to 50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute, or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.  Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.  >And no, I'm not going to even think of buying one.  I'm not that crazy.  Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.  >-Paul ""mine'll do 50,000 feet and carries 50 pounds of dynamite"" Dokas  That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE ROCKETS. NONE!

First somebody was accusing him of being self-righteous and unconvincing. Now we are told that we Christians should be embarrassed by him. (As well as by Josh McDowell, about whom I have no comment, having never read his work.)  Anyone who thinks that C. S. Lewis was self-righteous ought to read his introduction to The Problem of Pain, which is his theodicy. In it, he explains that he wanted to publish the book anonymously. Why? Although he believed in the argument he was presenting, he did not want to seem to presume to tell others how brave they should be in the face of their own suffering. He did not want people to think that he was presenting himself as some kind of model of fortitude, or that he was anything other than what he considered himself to be -- ""a great coward.""  OFM has adequately handled the question of whether we ought to be embarrassed by Lewis' liar/lunatic/lord argument (which, by the way, is part of a *much* bigger discourse.) I would just like to add that, far from being embarrassed by Lewis, I am in a state of continual amazement at the soundness and clarity of the arguments he presents.  - Phil -  Hey, we're talking about the PHONE COMPANY, here.

Jesus is the head of the body, the church B.  You cannot say ""yes"" to Jesus, but ""no"" to the church  Ephesians 2:19-22 A.  The church is the family of God B.  The church is based on the Word of God only Cornerstone=Christ Foundation= Apostles=New Testament Prophets=Old Testament  (see Revelation 21:9-14)  1 Corinthians 12:12-13 A.  Baptism is when we become a member of the church  As for the question of denominations: A.  The Bible teaches that there is only ONE church from Ephesians 4:4-6, Romans 12:4-5, 1 Corinthians 12:12-13 B.  1 Corinthians 1:10-13 says that there should be no divisions in the church.  There should be no following of personalities in the church (and in time, their writings) C.  There are so many churches today because of a problem.  2 Timothy 4:1-4 says that people will turn away from the truth and try to find a church that teaches a doctrine that suits their lifestyle  Hebrews 10:24-25 A.  Do not miss church B.  Purpose is to encourage each other, so we will remain faithful. Involved on a relationship level in the church C.  Must come to ALL services  Another verse which is helpful is Hebrews 3:12-15.  The church should be encouraging daily, as it is their duty to do.  Of course, more standards apply: 1 Timothy 4:16  People in the church should be watching their lives and doctrines to make sure they both live up to the Word entirely (ie, disciples). Acts 17:10-12  The pastor does not come close to the Apostle Paul (natural conclusion since the Apostle Paul talked with Jesus directly face to face), so if the Bereans, who were considered noble, didn't take Paul at his word but checked out what he said with Scripture to verify his statements, then church members are to do the same and verify the pastor's statements.  If they are not verifiable or valid in light of other verses, then that group should be avoided as a church (would've made a wonderful suggestion to the Waco group, especially in light of Matthew 24).

I am not so sure of Jewish proselytism then, but I would like to relate an account of a recent dinner I had with Jews a few months ago.  The dinner was instigated by the aunt of the hostess, whom I had met while visiting my wife in Galveston last October.  The dear old aunt (now deceased) was very proud of her Jewish heritage, although not especially devout.  Her parents were both murdered in Nazi concentration camps in Austria during WWII because they were Jewish.  While conversing with her about politics, world affairs and religion, she remarked that it would be a good idea for me to visit her niece on my return to Atlanta.  Within two days of returning to Atlanta, her niece called to invite me over for dinner with her husband.  I went, not knowing really what to expect, other than stimulating conversation and fellowship.  What I got, however, was rather unexpected.  The thrust of the evening's discussion was to condemn the Reagan-Bush policies prohibiting abortion counseling in federally funded family planning clinics, prohibiting the sterilization of minorities on welfare here and in Puerto Rico, on the ban on fetal tissue research, and against the Mexico City policy, ""which denies U.S. foreign aid to programs overseas that promote abortion.""  The crux of their position was to place the blame for the problems of ""overpopulation,"" rampant domestic crime, African starvation, unwed mothers, etc., on Christianity, rather on the fall of Adam.  Now, this is not what I had to come to talk about.  But every time I tried to bring up the subject of Judaism, they would condemn Jews for Jesus and admonish me against converting to Judaism, ""because it involves too much study and effort.""  And I did not even raise the prospect, nor try to convert them to the truth of Christ!  There was certainly no Jewish proselytism going on there.  And again, last November I toured a ""traditional"" Jewish synagogue and was subjected to a 30-minute harangue against Jesus and Christianity in general.  I realize that these are two isolated incidents, and that the best supervisor I ever had at work is Jewish, but from my experience, the modern Jew is not known for his proselytism.   -- boundary  no teneis que pensar que yo haya venido a traer la paz a la tierra; no he venido a traer la paz, sino la guerra (Mateo 10:34, Vulgata Latina) "

The purpose of science is to produce a model of the *physical* world.  The model must be able to explain all past observations and predict the outcome of future observations.  One of the aims of experiments is to carry out well defined observations which are objective.  Ideally scientist will except the model which best describes the world, and the model which realises on the minimal number of assumptions.  At the moment models which do not rely on the assumption of some *spiritual* world existing are equally powerful to ones which assume the assumption of a *spiritual* world.  As the non-spiritual models has fewer assumptions it should be the currently accepted models.  The scientific process never assumes that its present models are the correct ones, whereas many religions claim to represent the truth.

Many pagans are involved in environmentalism--this is only natural, since respect for the earth is a fundamental tenet of all pagan denominations.  This doesn't mean that environmentalism is wrong, any more than supporting peace in the Middle East is wrong because Jews and Muslims also work for it.  Nonetheless, paganism is certainly on the rise, and we as Christians should address this and look at what draws people from paganism to Christianity.  Like it or not, pagan religions are addressing needs that Christianity should be, and isn't. I believe that paganism has hit upon some major truths that Christianity has forgotten.  This doesn't mean that paganism is right, but it does mean that we have something to learn from the pagan movement. First, paganism respects the feminine.  Christianity has a long history of oppressing women, and many (if not most) male Christians are still unable to live in a non-sexist manner.  The idea that God is sexless, or that Christ could have been a women and still accomplished his mission, is met with a great deal of resistance.  This insistance on a male-dominated theology (and the male-dominated society that goes with it) drives away many young women who have had to put up with sexist attitudes in their churches. Second, paganism respects the physical world.  This is an idea with great ramifications.  One of these is environmentalism--respect for our surroundings and our world.  Another is integration of sexuality.  Christianity has a long tradition of calling ALL sexual feeelings sinful and urging people to suppress and deny their sexuality.  This is too much--sex is clearly a part of human experience and attempting to remove it is simply not a feasible option. Christianity has only begun to develop a workable sexual ethic, and paganism is an attractive option. I'm not advocating that Christian doctrines (no sex before marriage, etc.) should be changed--just that Christians work toward a more moderate ethic of sexuality.  Denial of sexuality places as much emphasis on sex as unmoderated sexuality, and neither one does much to bring us closer to God.

soc.religion.christian	" From: xx155@yfn.ysu.edu (Family Magazine Sysops) Subject: THE EMPTY TOMB... Reply-To: xx155@yfn.ysu.edu (Family Magazine Sysops) Organization: St. Elizabeth Hospital, Youngstown, OH Lines: 218    THE EMPTY TOMB:  CAN WE TRUST IT?  by the late Wilbur M. Smith, D.D. (1894-1977)  When Jesus was on Earth, He made an amazing prediction about Himself, and frequently repeated it.  Let me quote it for you:  Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him; and the third day He shall rise again"" (Matthew 20:18-19).  Wholly different from the normal experience of men, Jesus, who had *never* done anything worthy of death, even deserving reproval, knew He would die before He was 40 years of age.  He knew the very city where He would die.  He knew that the religious leaders of His own race would condemn Him to death.  He knew that one of His own would betray Him.  He knew that before His actual death took place He would be mocked and scourged.  He knew exactly how He would die--*by crucifixion.*  All this is in itself remarkable.  But more amazing than the minute particulars of His foreknowledge was what He predicted would follow shortly after He was buried--*that He would rise again.*  He even designated the time--on the third day.  But since it is on this central fact--the death and resurrec- tion of Jesus Christ--that the whole truth or untruth of Chris- tianity turns, let us examine it more closely.  The body of Jesus was embalmed in long sheets of cloth between the layers of which a great abundance of spices and ointments was distributed.  The body was placed in a tomb which had never before been used, and a great stone was rolled against the entrance.  The Jewish authorities, fully aware that Jesus had predicted He would rise again, had the stone officially sealed and on Saturday placed a guard before the tomb to prevent the disciples from carrying away the body.  Early Sunday morning some of the women who were faithful followers of Christ went out to the tomb to further anoint the body.  To their utter astonishment, they found the stone rolled away, the body gone.  They rushed back to tell the disciples.  Shortly two of Jesus' friends, Peter and John, utterly skeptical about the whole affair, came and found the tomb empty, just as the women had said.  Even the guards came hurrying into the city to tell the Sanhedrin that had hired them to guard the tomb that the body was gone (Matthew 28:11).  How did this tomb become empty?  One of the most famous New Testament scholars in America-- professor of New Testament literature in a large theological seminary--wrote to the author in answer to my question of *how* the tomb became empty, and wrote it in a letter *not* marked by bitterness or sarcasm, that he could no more explain how the tomb became empty than he could explain how Santa Claus comes down the chimney at Christmas time.  But he didn't realize that Santa Clause never did come down any chimney at Christmas time, *because there never was a Santa Claus!*  ...And there *is* a Jesus.  He died; He was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimathea, and on Sunday the body was gone.  Those are facts of history.  No one can escape the responsi- bility of coming to some conclusion about what really happened by mentioning a myth we all abandoned before we were eight years old.  Another professor, Dr. Kirsopp Lake of Harvard University, tried to explain the empty tomb by saying (what no other scholar in the field of New Testament criticism has ventured to adopt) that the women went to the wrong tomb.  The facts are these:  First, so far as we know, there was no other tomb nearby to which by mistake they could have gone.  Second, it is contrary to all similar experience for three or more people to forget the place where they have buried their dearest loved one within less than three days.  Even if the women did miss the tomb, when Peter and John came, did they too go to the wrong tomb?  Third, were the soldiers *guarding* the wrong tomb?  There is, of course, a record of an attempt to escape the evidence of the empty tomb in the New Testament itself.  Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came into the city and showed unto the chief priests all the things that were done.  And when they were assembled with the leaders and had taken counsel, they gave large money unto the soldiers, Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole Him away while we slept.  And if this come to the governor's ears, we will persuade him, and secure you.  So they took the money, and did as they were taught:  and this saying is com- monly reported among the Jews until this day (Matthew 28:11-15).  This is a good illustration of many later attempts to escape the fact that the tomb was empty.  You will notice at once that the chief priests and the elders never questioned but that the tomb *was* empty.  They never even went out to see if what the guards had reported was true--they *knew* it was true.  Another fact about this story makes it ridiculous to maintain that the tomb was empty--the soldiers were told to say that Jesus' disciples came and stole the body away *while they* (the soldiers) *were asleep!*  How could they know what was going on while they were asleep? Obviously, such testimony would be valueless in any court.  Even aside from the shallowness and sordidness that make us reject the explanation, the very character and the later history of the disciples compel us to believe they did not steal and secretly carry away the body of Jesus.  First, as Professor Heffern points out, the leaders of Judaism in Jerusalem, who had put the Lord Jesus to death, had nothing to offer to contradict these disciples as they continued to preach Jesus and His resurrection--because all Jerusalem knew the tomb was empty.  If there had been trickery here, sooner or later it would have been suspected, then proved.  Second, surely *one* of the disciples, even *most* of them, would have confessed the fraud under the terrific persecution they underwent. It may be possible to live a lie, but men seldom die for a lie--and most of these men did.  The result ultimately would have been that the message that Christ had risen would have suffered the fate of all such unfounded stories--it would have lost it *power.*  Instead, this truth swept the world, closed pagan temples, won millions of disciples, brought hope to a despairing humanity, was the very foundation truth of the early church, and is today as believable and as freshly glorious as ever.  But not only did Jesus come alive again, He did not disappear to leave the disciples speculating through all the subsequent days as to what had happened to Him.  Instead, He appeared to them--literally, visibly, frequently.  He appeared to the women at the tomb on Resurrection morning (Matthew 28:1-10); later that day to Mary Magdalene alone (John 20:11- 18); and to Simon Peter, also alone (Luke 24:34).  In the afternoon He walked with two of His followers toward Emmaus (Luke 24:13-35); and that night He appeared to ten of the apostles gathered together in an upper room at Jerusalem (Mark 16:14-16; Luke 24:36-40; etc.).  A week later He appeared to all eleven of the apostles, probably at the same place (John 20:26-28).  Once He was seen by above 500 brethren on a mountain in Galilee (I Corinthians 15:6); and finally to the apostles just before His ascension (Mark 16:19; Luke 24:50-52; Acts 1:3- 8).  As with the fact of the empty tomb, so in regard to these histor- ically recorded appearances, all kinds of theories have been proposed attempting to deny their literalness.  But these theories are unreasonable, without supporting evidence.  None has ever won the unanimous approval of those who refuse to believe in the reality of the appearances.  Moreover, while it is true we are living in an age when may of our leading scientists and agnostics and many of our philosophers are antisuperanaturalistic, let us not forget that some of the greatest thinkers of the ages have firmly believed in this great miracle. Increase Mather, president of Harvard; Timothy Dwight, president of Yale; Nathan Lord, president of Dartmouth; Edward Hitchcock, president of Amherst; Mark Hopkins, president of Williams; John Witherspoon, president of Princeton--these men and countless others have believed it.  But suppose Christ *did* rise from the dead, what of it?  What has it to do with *my* life?  What has it to do with *your* life?  Just this: it seals with certitude the teachings of Christ.  Jesus taught many great truths--especially many about Himself.  He claimed to have come down *from* God.  He said He was the way *to* God.  He said He was the Son of God, who alone knew God perfectly.  He said that whoever believed on Him had eternal life, and no one else had it.  He said that whatever we ask God in His name, He would grant it to us.  Thus when He did rise from the grave on the third day, He revealed that in these amazing, unparalleled predictions, *He spoke the truth!*  Do you know any reason, *any good reason,* why we should not believe that His words are all true?  The point is, does not the truth of the Resurrection convince us that He is none other than the One He claimed to be--the Son of God?  And then, of course, the fact that Christ rose from the dead testifies that He has broken the power of death, and that He will some day raise us also up from the grave, as He promised.  In other words, if this Person, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, in all this, He should be the cornerstone of the foundation of your life.  For He said a life built on Him would know forgiveness of sins, His compan- ionship and help, a joy that no circumstances can ever take away, and a hope that shineth more and more unto a perfect day.  Those who have tried it down through the ages--*and there have been many*--have given their testimony.  And we today who believe also know. "

Similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before. The $25k Orteig prize helped Lindbergh sell his Spirit of Saint Louis venture to his financial backers.  If memory serves, the $25k prize would not have been enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects (such as Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh ultimately kept his total costs below that amount.  But I strongly suspect that his Saint Louis backers had the foresight to realize that much more was at stake than $25,000.

As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993"" (which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to $450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward revision in Department of Defense launch plans."" Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

In general, not a bad report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth $100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business. Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid- year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top $3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected.) It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.]  2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches. Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation, and not yet final. The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years. Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand"" services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request. [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping MDC as a viable commerical launch company. However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches. But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs (including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter"" program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking US Defense budget.]  3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD"" The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral images of the Earth. [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists, agricultural planners, and urban planners. It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so.]  4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT"" Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent analyst's report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash- generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and $100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur program is back on track, this division will continue to show substantial losses. In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability. To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm. In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction (Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the $700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company.]  5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade. Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to about 3000 kg in GEO. Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near-term transponders. One of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI. Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit. I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space- based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to- multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service, but only from established point A to established point B. To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars. For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic. Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals. And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over- supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches.]  6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules. In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call. Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used in the launch. [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch. At the time of writing this column, some of the initial investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test. After the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch. According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch. As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved. This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they do with commercial aircraft problems). I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated.]  7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components. Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the ""Aerokosmos"" winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"", launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. This one's a little different in that they are offering variants of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing.]  8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development. This might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include: - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs? - Is there a market advantage of using the site? - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site? - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment? Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]  9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING In one of his last official acts, former President Bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands. Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor launch vehicle as well as from the US. [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher. However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on system). This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to find any other European development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware. Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970's and early 1980's. What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system. It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract.]  10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully- enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the Swedish satellite was not specified. [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit. PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors. PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least $550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to design, build and launch their first set of vehicles. The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real hardware.]  11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works. As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the satellite's communications channels. [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 M) through 2006. I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection. While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures. The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat- 2"", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed. In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This is just another indicator to add to the list.]  12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 2000. [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry, specifically including space activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market. As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US $8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea."" Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment- monitoring micro-satellite. This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors. South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the Korean peninsula. In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.). This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies. Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade.]  13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this trend.

If all that is required is that people are willing to die for a belief for it to be true, then surely David Koresh is the son of God.  No, the spurrious arguement that the resurrection had to be true for people to be willing to die must be put to rest.  The other problem is that it is so monologocentric.  Even if the resurrection was a big deal (which it doesn't seem to have been for either Q, Thomas, or even John to a certain degree) there are a lot of other things which the Early Christians could have been doing together that would have been worth dying for.  It is my belief that even the idea of a mixed race community, which brought down regional/national boundaries in the name of koinonia could have been enough for people to be willing to die.  Radical communties do that (e.g. Jonestown, Waco, Warsaw, etc) But my original point was that roman persecution (which is the only persecution we have documented proof of) was not about whether a carpenter came back from the dead.  Such a claim was not unique nor particularly abhorent to the roman or greek mind.  My point is that avoidance of military and civic duty (i.e. emperor worship) would have been much more problematic -- which has nothing to do with the resurrection at all.  When nero used christians as human torches to light up his dinner party it wasn't because the believe in a risen savior, it was because they were supposedly involved in incest and cannablism.  The argument that christians were martyred for the resurrection just cannot stand up to critical examination.  randy

Sexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an enormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that they are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not discuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel department that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most companies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety does seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.  It is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is not inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee problems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do notice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of higher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the entire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with you.

The point that Darren raises is a very Lutheran viewpoint. While reason is a gift from God, it is also infected by sin. Yet we do not reject reason entirely--and neither, I think, does Darren.  We need reason, as Darren himself has pointed out, to comprehend God's revelation of himself in the Bible. But reason alone is not sufficient to comprehend and believe the Word.  We need, first and foremost, faith.  For ""the sinful mind is hostile to God.  It does not submit to God's law, *nor can it do so*""  (Romans 8:7).  Luther accepted Scripture as the sole means of revelation (""Sola Scriptura""), but accepted the necessity of the use of reason (with faith) in comprehending that revelation. Yet Luther also said, regarding baptism, ""But mad reason rushes forth, and, because Baptism is not dazzling like the works which we do, regards it as worthless."" (Large Catechism, Fourth part, Baptism).  To make matters more complicated, Luther was the sort of theologian that many people would describe as an `absolutist'.  I've seen him described as a `take no prisoners' theologian.  We might conclude, given these observations, that Luther was inconsistent or mad.  And surely at least some have come to that conclusion.  But it might be useful to recall that Jesus was also called mad.  And Peter felt compelled to defend himself and the apostles against a charge of drunkenness on Pentecost.  So we as Christians ought to be careful about rejecting Luther (or others) as mad.  Rather, we should imitate the Bereans, who examined the Scriptures every day to see if what Paul said was true (Acts 17:11).  The basis for the confidence with which Luther, Peter, Paul, and many others preached the gospel was not just reason, but faith and the Holy Spirit.  This is not faith divorced from reason, but a faith that guides, informs, and uses reason.  The Spirit enables us to know the truth and to proclaim it boldly.  God does not want us to preach the message that ""I think that Jesus might have risen from the dead"" but rather ""I know that my redeemer lives!""  (Job 19:25).  The Christian does not side with Pilate in saying ""What is truth?"" but rather follows Christ, who said, ""In fact, for this reason I was born, and for this I came into the world, to testify to the truth.  Everyone on the side of truth listens to me"" (John 18:37).  We can know the truth because God has promised us that we can know the truth.  Jesus said, ""If you hold to my teachings, you are really my disciples.  Then you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free"" (John 8:31,32).  The Proverbs urge us ""Buy the truth, and do not sell it."" (Pr 23:23). The Psalmist prayed ""Do not snatch to word of truth from my mouth"" (Ps 119:43).  Evidently he believed that the word of truth was in fact `in his mouth'.  Yet we do indeed appear arrogant if our claim to the truth is motivated by self-glorification.  But if we present the truth as the teachings of Scripture, revealed by the Spirit, and not our own invention, and if we stand ready to be proved wrong on the basis of Scripture, as Luther did, then we are not arrogant, but humble.  We should humbly trust in God's promise of truth, just as we trust in his promise of forgiveness.  REXLEX> It is only because of God's own revelation that we can be REXLEX> absolute about a thing.  Darren> But how far does that get you?  Once God's revelation stops, Darren> and your own reasoning begins, possibility for error appears.  I agree that we must make a distinction between the clear teachings of Scripture, and the products of our own reason--even when such reasoning is based on Scripture.  However I think I would draw the line of distinction more `reasonably'  :-)  and less `academically' than you would.  Darren> For example, let's suppose that our modern Bible translations Darren> include a perfect rendering of Jesus words at the Last Supper, Darren> and that Jesus said, exactly, ""This is my body.""  Darren> We'll presume that what he said was totally without error and Darren> absolutely true.  What can we be certain of?  Not much.  Darren> At the moment he stops speaking, and people start Darren> interpreting, the possibility of error appears.  Did he mean Darren> that literally or not?  We do not have any record that he Darren> elaborated on the words.  Was he thinking of Tran- or Con- Darren> substantiation?  He didn't say.  Darren is almost at the point of making a very Lutheran statement about the Lord's supper.  The Lutheran approach is to say that if Jesus said, ""This is my body,"" then that is what we should believe.  Other interpretations are rejected simply because they are not taught in Scripture.  Recall that Jesus' words do not stand alone on this subject.  We also have Paul's words in 1 Corinthians 11:17-34,--in which he passed on to us, what he received from the Lord.  In particular he said, ""For whenever you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.""  By these words we should believe that the bread that we eat in the Lord's Supper really is bread (as well as the Lord's body)--as our senses in fact tell us.  Does this *prove* that tran-substantiation is false?  I suppose someone could say that Paul spoke metaphorically of the Lord's body as bread, simply because that is the way the body appears when we eat it.  But this thought is found nowhere in Scripture.  So we reject it.  Thus the primary reason for rejecting tran-substantiation is not that we can prove it false, but that it is simply not found in Scripture.  [side remark] I've been told that the Lutheran doctrine on real presence is con-substantiation.  But it has been non-Lutherans who have told me this.  We tend not to use the word.  I almost think that this is used more by professors of comparative religion, who need labels to compare Catholic, Lutheran and Reformed teachings on the Lord's Supper.  But almost every church wants to call their own teaching ""real presence"" because that was the traditional teaching of the church. [end side remark]  Darren> When Christians speak as if they believe their own reasoning Darren> can never lead them astray -- when we implicitly claim that we Darren> are infallible -- the non- Christians around us rarely believe Darren> that implicit claim.  Witnessing is hardly going to work when Darren> the person you are talking to believes that you are either too Darren> foolish to recognise your own limits, or intentionally trying Darren> to cover them up.

The first part of the two-part article was on the scandalous activities of Archbishop Weakland (in this country), but I cut all that.  And I pared down the rest to what was relevant.  Joe Buehler  ...  Schism and Disobedience  According to St. Thomas Aquinas, schism consists primarily in a refusal of submission to the Pope or communion with the members of the Church united to him. On first sight it would appear that, whatever the subjective motivation of the Archbishop, as discussed above, he must be in a state of objective schism as he has refused to submit to the Pope on a very grave matter involving his supreme power of jurisdiction. However, standard Catholic textbooks of theology make it clear that while all schisms involve disobedience not all acts of disobedience are schismatic. If this were so, as was noted at the beginning of this article, it would mean that the number of American bishops who are not schismatic would not reach double figures.  The distinction between disobedience and schism is made very clear in the article on schism in the very authoritative Dictionnaire de Theologie Catholique. The article is by Father Yves Congar who is certainly no friend of Archbishop Lefebvre.  He explains that schism and disobedience are so similar that they are often confused. Father Congar writes that schism involves a refusal to accept the existence of legitimate authority in the Church, for example, Luther's rejection of the papacy. Father Congar explains that the refusal to accept a decision of legitimate authority in a particular instance does not constitute schism but disobedience.  The Catholic Encyclopedia explains that for a Catholic to be truly schismatic he would have to intend ""to sever himself from the Church as far as in him lies.""  It adds that ""not every disobedience is schism; in order to possess this character it must include besides the transgression of the command of the superiors, a denial of their divine right to command.""Not only does Mgr. Lefebvre not deny the divine right of the Pope to command, but he affirms repeatedly his recognition of the Pope's authority and his intention of never breaking away from Rome. The Archbishop made his attitude clear in the July/August 1989 issue of 30 Days: ""We pray for the Pope every day. Nothing has changed with the consecrations last June 30. We are not sedevacantists. We recognize in John Paul II the legitimate Pope of the Catholic Church. We don't even say that he is a heretical Pope. We only say that his Modernist actions favor heresy.""  ...  Intrinsically Schismatic?  The principal argument used by those claiming that Mgr. Lefebvre is in schism is that the consecration of a bishop without a papal mandate is an intrinsically schismatic act. A bishop who carries out such a consecration, it is claimed, becomes ipso facto a schismatic. This is not true. If such a consecration is an intrinsically schismatic act it would always have involved the penalty of excommunication. In the 1917 Code of Canon Law the offence was punished only by suspension (see Canon 2370 of the 1917 Code). Pope Pius XII had raised the penalty to excommunication as a response to the establishment of a schismatic church in China. The consecration of these illicit Chinese bishops differed radically from the consecrations carried out by Mgr. Lefebvre as the professed intention was to repudiate the authority of the Pope, that is, to deny that he has the right to govern the Church, and the illicitly consecrated Chinese bishops were given a mandate to exercise an apostolic mission. Neither Archbishop Lefebvre nor any of the bishops he has consecrated claim that they have powers of jurisdiction. They have been consecrated solely for the purpose of ensuring the survival of the Society by carrying out ordinations and also to perform confirmations. I do not wish to minimize in any way the gravity of the step take by Mgr. Lefebvre. The consecration of bishops without a papal mandate is far more serious matter than the ordination of priests as it involves a refusal in practice of the primacy or jurisdiction belonging by divine right to the Roman Pontiff. But the Archbishop could argue that the crisis afflicting the Church could not be more grave, and that grave measures were needed in response.  It appears to be taken for granted by most of the Archbishop's critics that he was excommunicated for the offense of schism, and the Vatican has certainly been guilty of fostering this impression.  There is not so much as a modicum of truth in this allegation. The New Code of Canon Law includes a section beginning with Canon 1364 entitled ""Penalties for Specific Offenses"" (De Poenis in Singula Dicta). The first part deals with ""Offenses against Religion and the Unity of the Church"" (De Delictis contra Religionem et Ecclesiae Unitatem). Canon 1364 deals with the offense of schism which is, evidently, together with apostasy and heresy, one of the three fundamental offenses against the unity of the Church.  But the Archbishop was not excommunicated under the terms of this canon or, indeed, under any canon involving an offense against religion or the unity of the church. The canon cited in his excommunication comes from the third section of ""Penalties for Specific Offenses"" which is entitled ""Usurpation of Ecclesial Functions and Offenses in their Exercise"" (De Munerum Ecclesiasticorum Usurpatione Degue Delictis iniis Exercendis). The canon in question is Canon 1382, which reads: ""A bishop who consecrates someone bishop and the person who receives such a consecration from a bishop without a pontifical mandate incur an automatic (latae sententiae) excommunication reserved to the Holy See.""  The scandalous attempts to smear Archbishop Lefebvre with the offense of schism are, then, contrary to both truth and charity. A comparable smear under civil as opposed to ecclesiastical law would certainly justify legal action for libel involving massive damages. An accurate parallel would be to state that a man convicted of manslaughter had been convicted of first degree murder.  I must stress that what I have written here is not the dubious opinion of laymen unversed in the intricacies of Canon Law. Canon lawyers without the least shred of sympathy for Mgr. Lefebvre have repudiated the charge of schism made against him as totally untenable. Father Patrick Yaldrini, Dean of the Faculty of Canon Law of the Institut Catholique in Paris noted in the 4 July 1988 issue of Valeurs actuelles that, as I have just explained, Mgr.  Lefebvre was not excommunicated for schism but for the usurpation of an ecclesiastical function. He added that it is not the consecration of a bishop which constitutes schism but the conferral of an apostolic mission upon the illicitly consecrated bishop. It is this usurpation of the powers of the sovereign pontiff which proves the intention of establishing a parallel Church.  Cardinal Rosalio Lara, President of the Pontifical Commission for the Authentic Interpretation of Canon Law, commented on the consecrations in the 10 July 1988 issue of la Repubblica. It would be hard to imagine a more authoritative opinion. The Cardinal wrote:  The act of consecrating a bishop (without a papal mandate) is not in itself a schismatic act. In fact, the Code that deals with offenses is divided into two sections. One deals with offenses against religion and the unity of the Church, and these are apostasy, schism, and heresy. Consecrating a bishop with a pontifical mandate is, on the contrary, an offense against the exercise of a specific ministry. For example, in the case of the consecrations carried out by the Vietnamese Archbishop Ngo Dinh Thuc in 1976 and 1983, although the Archbishop was excommunicated he was not considered to have committed a schismatic act because there was no intention of a breach with the Church.  ....  It is not simply unjust but ludicrous to suggest that in consecrating bishops without a papal mandate Archbishop Lefebvre had the least intent of establishing a schismatic church. He is not a schismatic and will never be a schismatic. The Archbishop considers correctly that the the Church is undergoing its worst crisis since the Arian heresy, and that for the good of the Church it was necessary for him to consecrate the four bishops to ensure the future of his Society. Canon Law provides for just such a situation, and even if one believes that the future of the Society could have been guaranteed without these consecrations, the fact that the Archbishop believed sincerely that it could not means, as Canon Law states clearly, that he has not incurred excommunication. Furthermore, while the Vatican allows such prelates as Archbishop Weakland to undermine the Faith with impunity it cannot expect Catholics to pay the least attention to its sanctions against a great and orthodox Archbishop whose entire life has been devoted to the service of the Church and the salvation of souls.  Dr. Eric M. de Saventhem, President of the International Una Voce Association, is one of the best informed laymen in the Church, and he knows the Archbishop intimately. Dr. de Saventhem, like myself, has no greater desire than to see a reconciliation between Mgr. Lefebvre and the Holy See during the Archbishop's lifetime. A quotation from a statement by Dr. de Saventhem which was published in the 15 February 1989 Remnant merits careful study:  In retrospect, the road leading to the consecrations of 30 June appears more paved with grave Roman (and, unfortunately, also papal) omissions than with Lefebvrist ""obstinancies."" And from the eyes of an informed public this cannot be hidden by attempting to present the Archbishop's act of grave disobedience as an offense against the Faith!  It is said--today--that Mgr. Lefebvre has ""an erroneous concept of Tradition."" If this were so, Cardinal Ratzinger could not, on behalf of the Pope, have addressed to the Archbishop the following words in his letter of 28 July 1987: ""Your ardent desire to safeguard Tradition by procuring for it 'the means to live and prosper' testifies to your attachment to the Faith of all time... the Holy Father understands your concern and shares it.""

My argument is mainly a proposal of what I think is a plausible argument against extra-marital sex -- one which I personally believe has some truth.  My main purpose for posting it here is to show that a _plausible_ argument can be made against extra-marital sex.  At this stage I am not saying that this particular viewpoint is proven or anything like that, just that it is plausible.  To try to convince you all of this particular point of view, I would probably have to do a lot of work researching what has been done in this field, etc., in order to gather further evidence, which I simply do not have time to do now.  Also note that I said that I think extra-marital sex is ""a prime cause"" (in my opinion) of the generally greater levels of psychological problems, especially depression, in Western societies.  I am not saying it is ""the prime cause"" or ""the only cause"", just ""a prime cause"" -- i.e. one of the significant contributions to this trend.  I think when you say you think my view is simplistic, you have forgotten this -- I admit that there are probably other factors, but I do think that extra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the family) is a significant factor in the rise in psychological problems like depression in Western society this century.

The basic question here is ""how do I know what I am supposed to do?"" This is true in every situation that comes up. Some people do not think about it at all and merely follow their impulses.

Ahh! An ironic ending.  The irony I was implying in my initial pithy retort to the bumper sticker cliche ""Question Authority"" was that I was questioning the authority of the person telling me to question authority. It seems there is a certain segment of society that finds meaning only in being different, only in rebelling, forsaking everything for the sake of freedom. I question their integrity and fortitude. There is another freedom that comes from doing a task correctly. Different people are at different levels of development in different areas. Part of the challenge of life is to find the right authorities to follow, we can't know everything about everything. Often when learning a new skill or subject I will follow the teacher, perhaps blindly. Only when I have learned enough to ask appropriate questions should I question him, only when I have developed my skills enough should I challenge him. Once again, how do I know when I get to those stages?  If you have to be told to question authority, perhaps you shouldn't.  Chris Mussack (A good comedian should never have to explain his jokes.) "

I haven't seen anybody write that AIDS was a *punishment* for certain types of sin (this includes Mark Ashley who you were responding to here).  I myself wrote that when you don't do things God's way that curses will come on you and others.

God doesn't cause curses, he warns us of them.  Kevin Davis wrote (a while ago): >Last week I was guilty of anger, jealousy, and whole mess of >other stuff, yet I am forgiven and not condemned to suffer with >AIDs.

Jesus has every reason to be angry at us for putting him on the cross with our sin, yet his prayer was ""forgive them Father, they know not what they do.""  Knowing how forgiving Jesus has been with me calls me to be more forgiving with everyone out of love for Him.  Please don't give in to anger, it will only cause foolish quarrels and more bad feelings.  It's okay if you read something that bothers you, but you need to address it in a loving way.  If right now, I felt like someone out there was saying that God punishes gay or sexually immoral people with AIDS because they deserve punishment that others don't then I would frame a response something like this:  ""It makes me feel very sad for someone to believe that AIDS, which is simply a harmful disease not so unlike any other, is God's punishment for people who have committed certain sins.  God loves all of his children equally and rejoices when a single one comes back to him.  We will all be judged after we die, but until then we all have the opportunity to accept God's grace by earnestly seeking after him with all of our hearts, believing the gospel's testimony, repenting of our sin, confessing that Jesus is Lord at baptism, and living a new life for him. Let us not judge someone to be eternally condemned.  God's arm is not to short to save.  He will do anything he can to move a hardened heart or a misled person.  He works for the good of all men.  Even through the worst of situations, he has set the times and places for all men that they may perhaps reach out and find him.""  The second issue you bring up is seeing people rationalize their fears of people with AIDS.  Fortunately, what you describe as seeing is actually misperceiving.  You have been missing the points made in the earlier posts and reacting in anger to attitudes that haven't been expressed.  I know that its sometimes hard to discount your perceptions, but please try to be open-minded.  You are quite correct in saying that we should reach out to all people because they all need Jesus.  This is what my brothers and sisters and I do on a daily basis.  If you would like to send me the name of the city and state you live in, I will find and get you in touch with some brothers who have AIDS or know people with AIDS and live nearby you so that you can see the loving attitudes for yourself.  The third issue you bring up is the importance of how some individual contracted AIDS.  How someone gets AIDS is only relevant to their salvation in that there may be repetence involved.  The important point to be made, however, is that not listening to God's commands (or advice or warnings), i.e. sinning, causes harm or misfortune to yourself and others.  For this reason, a good way to prevent the misfortune of AIDS, which can be transmitted in sinful ways, is to listen to God's advice and have sex only with your wife or husband.  I hope that you are feeling better now, Paul.  Love,  Aaron Cardenas "

From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about ""High Power Rocketry"", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular. Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.  Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch. Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and all of the launches are then covered under this ""blanket waiver"". There is also a ""High Power Safety Code"" which designates more specific rules such as launch field size, etc.  Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket motors you need to certified through either the National Association of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures require a demonstarted handling and ""safe"" flight at a total impulse level.  For more information, watch rec.models.rockets newsgroup.  R.

Unfortunately I don't have direct quotes handy...  1) Atheists believe that when they die, they die forever.  2) A god who would condemn those who fail to believe in him to eternal death is unfair.  I don't see what the problem is!  To Christians, Hell is, by definition, eternal death--exactly what atheists are expecting when they die.  There's no reason Hell has to be especially awful--to most people, eternal death is bad enough. Literal interpreters of the Bible will have a problem with this view, since the Bible talks about the fires of Hell and such.  Personally, I don't think that people in Hell will be thrust into flame any more than I expect to Jesus with a double-edged sword issuing from his mouth--I treat both these statements as metaphorical.

In fact, I may post some of it here (if it isn't too long).  >They were encyclopaedic information >which anybody can access - that slavery was abolished at certain >dates some 1200 years after Muhammed, that this was the cause >of tensions in the Ottoman empire between the Arab slave traders >and the government etc..

I haven't read Lewis's article, so I can't comment directly upon it, and have only spoken about his writings _in general_ so far, that his political motives make him a biased writer on Islam.  His anti-Islamic polemics, as I understand it, are often quite subtle and are often based on telling half-truths.  Again, read ""Orientalism"" by Edward Said.  I am _not_ asking you to take what I say on trust, in fact I am urging you not to do so but to get this book (it is a well-known book) and check the evidence out for _yourself_.  >The issue I raised was that slaves WERE USED FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES, >when it was claimed that Islam prohibits extra-marital sex. >I wrote that the Prophet himself had concubines, I wrote an >incident in which the prophet advised on someone who did not >want his concubine to get pregnant etc., which is contrary >to the notion that ""sex is for procreation only"".

Some of the points you repeat above I have already answered before.  Regarding women, I have made posting after posting on this subject, showing that Islam is not anti-woman, etc.  However, have you been completely ignoring my postings or just missing them?  I just reposted a very good one, under the title ""Islam and Women"", reposted from soc.religion.islam.  If this has already disappeared from your site, then please email me telling me so and I will email you a copy of this excellent article.  IMHO, your understanding of the issue of women in Islam is sadly deficient.  Regarding slaves, _my_ posting on slavery -- the second one I made, which is a repost of an article I wrote early last year -- is based completely on the Qur'an and contains numerous Qur'anic verses and hadiths to support its point of view.  Our approaches are different -- you are arguing from a historical standpoint and I am arguing directly from the teachings of the Qur'an and hadiths.  Now, just because people say they are Muslims and perform a particular action, does that automatically mean that their action is part of Islam, even if it is opposed by the Qur'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of course not.  Let me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify this for you.  The Qur'an prohibits drinking.  Now, if a person says ""I am a Muslim"" and then proceeds to drink a bottle of beer, does this now mean that Islam teaches that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and only an idiot would think so.  Do you see my point?  >It is very natural to think that >the author/authors of the Quran had no idea that the socio-economic >structure they were advocating would experience at least two paradigm >shifts in 1400 years in the western cultures - first with the end of >the feudal era and the rise of commerce, second with the industrial >revolution.

In fact, the rise of Islam can easily be modeled >after the pyramid effect - you do not produce any wealth at home, >but increase your wealth by conquering places.  You are judging Islam here on capitalist terms.  Capitalism is an ideology based largely on the assumption that people want to maximise their wealth -- this assumption is in opposition to Islamic teachings. To say Islam is bad because it is not capitalist is pretty unthinking -- Islam does not pretend to be capitalist and does not try to be capitalist.  (This does not mean that Islam does not support a free-market -- for it does in general -- but there are other parts of capitalism which are opposed to Islam as I understand it.)  >When this stopped, >you (and I) were left bare in the open for emperialists to devour. >No capital, no industry, very poor social services - the education >level in Muslim countries are the lowest in the world, the health >statistics are miserable etc..  One can postulate numerous reasons for this.  Your theory is that it is because Islam is not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.  Selim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the fallacy of your views if you think (as you obviously do) that Islam => lack of education and power.  For a large part of history, the Islamic world was very powerful.  For a significant section of history, the Islamic world was the foremost in the sciences.  So to say that Islam is, for example, anti-education is completely absurd.  You try to blame this situation on Islam -- history shows that your conclusion is false and that, instead, there must be other reasons for this situation.  >You blame Muslims for not following the Quran, but I blame Muslims >for following the Quran.  Well, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam makes me question the extent of your knowledge of Islam.  I really think you are not knowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslims are following the Qur'an or not.  >Your idea is baseless from historical >facts, it is a poor utopia,  The Islamic world was at the forefront of the world in science at one stage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it is by ""following the Qur'an"" that Muslims are backwards in education.  Selim, it is _your_ thesis that is anti-historical, for you conveniently overlook this historical fact which contradicts your theory.  >while my ideas are derived from social >and economic history.  You have certainly not shown this; you have merely stated it. So far, it seems to me that your view on Islam being anti-education is quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinced of your views makes me wonder just how objectively you are trying to look at all of this.  >My solution to all Muslims is simple: >CUT THE CRAP,  I think, Selim, you should consider taking your own advice.  >GET THE FACTS STRAIGHT  Here too.  >AND WORK HARD TO REVERSE >THE EFFECTS OF 1300 YEARS OF IGNORANCE.  Selim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate ignorance, not only of Islam but also of Islamic history (particularly with respect to Muslims being leaders of science till about 1400 or so I think).  Yet you say that your viewpoint is based on history!  Selim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier posts that you are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start thinking clearly about the issues, and start _reading_ some of our postings about Islam rather than ignoring them as you so obviously have.

'Easter' is a pagan word all right, but it has nothing to do with Ishtar. If 'Easter' and 'Ishtar' were related, their history would show it. But in Old English, Easter was 'Eostre', cognate with English 'East' and German 'Ost'.   The reconstructed Proto-Germanic form is 'Austron'. Not until after 1400 did 'Easter' have a high front vowel like 'Ishtar'. Clearly, the two words have quite separate origins.

Lines: 106  {I sent in something on this before but I believe it got lost in the weekend accident the moderator described.  This is an improved version anyway so no loss the first time.  HL}  The standard work on detecting forgeries of ancient documents is probably the writing of Friedrich Blass, ""Hermeneutrik und Kritik,"" _Einleitende und Hilfsdisziplinen_, vol 1 of _Handbuch der Klassischen Altertums- wissenshaft_ (Noerdlingen: Beck, 1886).  Portions of this are described in Nibley, _The Prophetic Book op Mormon_, pp 219-242 (SLC:  Deseret Book, 1989). (If you want to attempt reading this be forewarned.  Nibley describes Blass as a typical German scholar who claims little knowledge of his subject, then proceeds to exhaust both the subject and the reader.)  Nibley's extract from Blass's work is in the form of ""rules for forgers.""  It makes interesting reading.  I confess that I have not read Blass's work, only Nibley's extract thereof.  My German falls far short of what would be required and as far as I know there is no English translation available.  However, I believe the techniques he describes are known widely enough that any competent classical scholar could examine a purportedly ancient document and at least determine if it is consistent with what one would expect of a genuine document of that time frame.  We will not be able to prove who wrote it but at least we should be able to determine with reasonable confidence if it is from that time and culture or is a later forgery.  Actually there are 2 types of purportedly ancient documents:  1.  Alleged actual holographs or early copies thereof.  For example the Dead Sea Scrolls.  These can be tested by various scientific means to determine the age of the paper, inks, and objects found with them.  This can provide a pretty clear dating of the actual physical objects.  2.  Documents claiming to be copies of ancient works although the copy itself may be much more recent.  For example we might find a document which monks in a monastary claim is a copy of something from centuries ago (perhaps even having been through several generations of copists).  This is more of a problem but can still be tested (although the test is not likely to be simple).  We cannot expect a test of the age of the physical objects to tell us much so we must confine our testing to the text itself.  It is important to remember that none of these tests can tell us if the document is really what it claims to be.  They can only date the document and identify its culture of origin.  For example I've heard of a letter supposed to have been written by Jesus himself to a king in what is now Iraq.  If this document were to actually turn up scholars could date the paper and ink (assuming they have the holograph).  They could check the language, content and writing style to see if they are consistent with what would be expected of a Palestinian Jew of that time.  However even if all test results were positive there is no way to determine if Jesus himself actually wrote it.  We would know what time and culture it came from but (barring a known sample of Jesus handwriting or other clues for comparison) scholarship must stop there.  There is seldom any way to determine who the actual author was.  As I say, I'm no expert on Blas's work.  I do remember some of the tests which can be applied to alleged copies of ancient works. Specifically we might ask:  1.  Is the document internally consistent?  Does it contradict itself?  If the work it is short it would be relatively easy to maintain internal consistency, even if it is a forgery.  The longer the forgery the more difficult it is to maintain consistency. For this reason most successful forgers stick to short documents.  2.  Is it consistent with the history and geography of the time? Again a short, non-specific work might not be testable but if the writing is of any significant length no latter-day forger would be able to escape detection.  Here we look for the minor, inconspicuous things which someone from that culture would get right without even thinking about it but which a later forger would find too numerous and trivial to check.  The devil is in the details.  3.  What about the literary style of the work, figures of speech etc.  Any ancient writer would almost certainly speak in ways that seem strange to us.  Are there any such odd phrases in this book? If so do they fit in with the culture?  Of course there are complications if the document has been translated, or possibly even if somebody just updated language when he copied it.  A few cases of language not from the culture claimed may be allowed in recent copies.  They cause problems and reduce certainty to be sure but don't necessarily prove forgery.  These tests can be quite effective (given enough material to work with) but they are not easy.  They require the skills of the historian, the linguist, the anthropologist etc.  The questions to ask are, ""Is every aspect of this document consistent with what we know about the culture of claimed origin?""  If there are things which don't fit how significant are they?  Are problem areas due to our lack of knowledge, later changes by copists or are they really significant?  There will often be some ambiguity since we never know everything about the culture.  The end result of any such testing is occasionally certain (particularly in the case of holographs or other ancient copies). However often it may just be a probability or an indication that the document (or maybe parts of it) is probably authentic (or sometimes maybe other parts are later additions).  This is often unsettling to a generation raised on TV where all problems are solved in 30 to 60 minutes with time out for commercials.  It is, however, the real world and what scholarship has to offer. "

Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the report and Discovery was launched with its ""extra payload"".  NASA officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th launch date.  The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster, its 18-inch long rope was still attached.

Mitchell March 23, 1993  INTRODUCTION:  In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment purposes. Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of information on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of a lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in Twenty-First century remote learning methods.  Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests and skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures, interfacing and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at the LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real facility exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the construction of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested by the users themselves.  This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups: - tele-operations and virtual reality research - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers - art and theater - bbs and online network users - software and game developers - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains - children - the child in all of us  LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:  A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth. The ""floor"" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and machine-lets.  The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets: 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land; 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.  Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.  The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to LTM1.  Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the SSTO to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar landscape and land.  Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.  By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours.  PLAN OF ACTION:  The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network. Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide ""rail stock"" for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets. An initial ""ground breaking"" with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony.  A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return to their campus.  A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media. Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community. Especially since the ""action"" will be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be invited to issue ""challenges"" to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.  The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education, experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a long term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!  CONCLUSION:  EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require real (not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in space.

In some parishes here in South Africa the only ones who receive communion are infants (i.e. children under 7). In our parish it is expected that one will have been to Vespers and confessional prayers the evening before, and that one will have been fasting.

My comments are based primarily on William Rusch's historical summary in ""The Trinitarian Controversy"", Fortress.  I'm going to save this as an FAQ.  --clh]  MAJOR VIEWS OF THE TRINITY  [SECOND CENTURY  The writers of the 2nd Cent. are important, because they set up much of the context for the later discussions.  Justin Martyr, Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian, and Theophilus of Antioch are known as the ""Apologists"".  Their theology has often been described as ""Logos theology"".  Based strongly on wording in John, they took more or less a two-phase approach.  Through eternity, the Logos was with the Father, as his mind or thought.  This ""immanent Word"" became ""expressed"" as God revealed himself in history, ultimately in Jesus. Thus Jesus' full distinction from the Father only became visible in history, though the Logos had been present in God from eternity. Rusch regards this view is containing many of the emphases of the final orthodox position, but in a form which is less sophisticated, because it did not have the technical language to properly deal with the eternal plurality in the Godhead.  Irenaeus held views somewhat similar to the Apologists.  However he was uncomfortable with the two-stage approach.  He still viewed God as one personage, with distinctions that did not become fully visible except through his process of self-revelation (the ""economy"").  The distinctions are present in his essential nature.  Irenaeus emphasized the Holy Spirit more than the Apologists.  Irenaeus' views should probably be called ""economic trinitarianism"", though that term is normally used (as below) to refer to later developments.   THIRD CENTURY  --clh]  Dynamic Monarchianism  Source: Theodotus Adherents: Paul of Samosota, Artemon, Socinus, Modern Unitarians Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God denotes both oneness of nature and oneness of person. The Son and the Holy Spirit therefore are consubstantial with the Father's divine essence only as impersonal attributes. The divine dunamis came upon the man Jesus, but he was not God in the strict sense of the word. Perception of God's Subsistence: The notion of a subsistent God is a palpable impossibility, since his perfect unity is perfectly indivisible. The 'diversity' of God is apparent and not real, since the Christ event and the work of the Holy Spirit attest only to a dynamic operation within God, not to a hypostatic union. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: Unique originator of the universe. He is eternal, self-existent, and without beginning or end. Son: A virtuous (but finite) man in whose life God was dynamically present in a unique way; Christ definitely was not deity though his humanity was deified. Holy Spirit: An impersonal attribute of the Godhead. No deity or eternality is ascribed to the Holy Spirit. Criticism(s): Elevates reason above the witness of biblical revelation concerning the Trinity. Categorically denies the deity of Christ and of the Holy Spirit, thereby undermining the theological undergirding for the biblical doctrine of salvation. [In summary, this probably best thought of as not being Trinitarianism at all.  God is an undifferentiated one.  Son and Holy Spirit are seen as simply names for the man Jesus and the grace of God active in the Church.  --clh]   Modalistic Monarchianism  Source: Praxeas Adherents: Noatus, Sabellius, Swedenborg, Scleiermacher, United Pentecostals (Jesus Only) Perception of God's Essence: The unity of God is ultra-simplex. He is qualitatively characterized in his essence by one nature and person.  This essence may be designated interchangeably as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. They are different names for but identical with the unified, simplex God. The three names are the three modes by which God reveals Himself. Perception of God's Subsistence: The concept of a subsistent God is erroneous and confounds the real issue of the phenomenon of God's modalistic manifesting of himself. The paradox of a subsisting ""three in oneness"" is refuted by recognizing that God is not three persons but one person with three different names and corresponding roles following one another like parts of a drama. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: Fully God and fully eternal as the primal mode or manifestation of the only unique and unitary God Son: Full deity/eternality ascribed only in the sense of his being another mode of the one God and identical with his essence. he is the same God manifested in temporal sequence specific to a role (incarnation). Holy Spirit: Eternal God only as the tile designates the phase in which the one God, in temporal sequence, manifested himself pursuant to the role of regeneration and sanctification. Criticism(s): Depersonalizes the Godhead. To compensate for its Trinitarian deficiencies, this view propounds ideas that are clearly heretical. Its concept of successive manifestations of the Godhead cannot account for such simultaneous appearances of the three persons as at Christ's baptism. [Rusch comments that evidence on these beliefs is sketchy.  There are actually two slightly different groups included: Noetus and his followers, and Sabellius.  Noetus was apparently more extreme. Sabellius followed him, and attempted to use some features of economic Trinitarianism to create a more sophisticated view.  Unfortunately, information about Sabellius comes from a century later, and there seems to be some confusion between him and Marcellus of Ancyra. --clh]  [I've moved the following description to be with the other third-century views.  It originally appeared near the end.  --clh]  ""Economic"" Trinitarianism  Source: Hippolytus, Tertullian Adherents: Various ""neo-economic"" Trinitarians Perception of God's Essence: The Godhead is characterized by triunity: Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are the three manifestations of one identical, indivisible substance. The perfect unity and consubstantiality are especially comprehended in such manifest Triadic deeds as creation and redemption. Perception of God's Subsistence: Subsistence within the Godhead is articulated by means of such terms as ""distinction"" and ""distribution"" dispelling effectively the notion of separateness or division. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: The equal deity of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is clearly elucidated in observation of the simultaneous relational/operational features of the Godhead. Co-eternality, at times, does not intelligibly surface in this ambiguous view, but it seems to be a logical implication. Criticism(s): Is more tentative and ambiguous in its treatment of the relational aspect of the Trinity. [Note that this is a development of the Apologists and Irenaeus, as mentioned above.  As with them, the threeness is visible primarily in the various ways that God revealed himself in history.  However they did say that this is a manifestation of a plurality that is somehow present in the Godhead from the beginning.  Tertullian talks of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as being three that are one in substance.  Many people regard this view as being essentially orthodox, but with less developed philosophical categories.  --clh]  [Origen, developing further an approach started by Clement, attempted to apply neo-Platonism to Christian thought.  He set many of the terms of the coming battle.  In Platonic fashion, he sees the Son as a mediator, mediating between the absolute One of God and the plurality of creating beings.  The Son is generated, but he is ""eternally generated"".  That is, the relationship between Father and Son is eternal.  It cannot be said that ""there was once when he was not"" (a phrase that will haunt the discussion for centuries).  Having the Son is intrinsic to his concept of God.  The Father and Son are described as separate ""hypostases"", though this may not have quite the meaning of separate subsistence that it had in some contexts.  The union is one of love and action, but there is some reason to think that he may have used the term homoousios (""of the same substance"").  The Holy Spirit is also an active, personal substance, originated by the Father through the Son.  Origen's intent is trinitarian, not tritheistic, but he pushes things in the direction of separateness.   FOURTH CENTURY  --clh]  Subordinationism  [often called Arianism --clh]  Source: Arius Major Adherents: Modern Jehovah's Witnesses, and several other lesser known cults Perception of God's Essence: The inherent oneness of God's nature is properly identifiable with the Father only. The Son and the Holy Spirit are discreet entities who do not share the divine essence. Perception of God's Subsistence: The unipersonal essence of God precludes the concept of divine subsistence with a Godhead. ""Threeness in oneness"" is self- contradictory and violates biblical principles of a monotheistic God. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: Father: The only one, unbegotten God who is eternal and without beginning. Son: A created being and therefore not eternal. Though he is to be venerated, he is not of the divine essence. Holy Spirit: A nonpersonal, noneternal emanation of the Father. He is viewed as an influence, an expression of God.  Deity is not ascribed to him. Criticism(s): It is at variance with abundant scriptural testimony respecting the deity of both Christ and the Holy Spirit. Its hierarchial concept likewise asserts three essentially separate persons with regard to the Father, Christ, and the Holy Spirit. This results in a totally confused soteriology. [Note also that in most versions of this view, the Son is not fully human either.  He is supernatural and sinless.  That distinguishes this view from adoptionism.  --clh]  Orthodox Trinitarianism  Source: Athanasius Adherents: Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Contemporary orthodox Christianity Perception of God's Essence: God's being is perfectly unified and simplex: of one essence.  This essence of deity is held in common by Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The three persons are consubstantial, coinherent, co-equal, and co- eternal. Perception of God's Subsistence: The divine subsistence is said to occur in three modes of being or hypostases. As such, the Godhead exists ""undivided in divided persons."" This view contemplates an identity in nature and cooperation in function without the denial of distinctions of persons in the Godhead. Asignation of Deity/Eternality: In its final distillation, this view unhesitatingly sets forth Father, Son, and Holy Spirit as co-equal and co-eternal in the Godhead with regard to both the divine essence and function. Criticism(s): The only shortcoming has to do with the limitations inherent in human language and thought itself: the impossibility of totally describing the ineffable mystery of ""three in oneness."" [At least in the 4th Cent, there were several different approaches, all of which fit the description here, and all regarded as orthodox, but which are somewhat different in detail.  Nicea was originally held to respond to Arius.  Arius can be thought of as carrying Origen's thought a bit too far, to the point of making the Son a separate entity.  In general the East tended to take an approach based on Origen's, and it was hard to get acceptance of Nicea in the East.  Its final acceptance was based on the work of Athanasius with the Cappadocians: Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory of Nazianzus, among others.  While starting with three, they show that their unity in nature and and action is such that one must think of them as being a single God.  This allowed the Council of Constantinople, in 381, to get wide agreement on the idea of three hypostatese and one ousia.  --clh]  Adapted from _Charts of Christian Theology and Doctrine_, by H.

When graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft, presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes 'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational) envelope'.  Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans, such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed taxi tests).

If you do sincerely believe that a god exists, why do you follow >it blindly?  Why do we follow God so blindly?  Have you ever asked a physically blind person why he or she follows a seeing eye dog? The answer is quite simple--the dog can see, and the blind person cannot.  I acknowledge, as a Christian, that I am blind.  I see, but I see  illusions as well as reality.  (Watched TV lately?) I hear, but I hear lies as well as truth.  (Listen to your radio or read a newspaper.)  Remember, all that tastes well is not healthy.  So, I rely one the one who can see, hear, and taste everything, and knows what is real, and what is not. That is God.  Of course, you may ask, if I cannot trust my own senses, how do I know whether what I see and hear about God is truth or a lie.  That is why we need faith to be saved.  We must force ourselves to believe that God knows the truth, and loves us enough to share it with us, even when it defies what we think we know.  Why would He have created us if He did not love us enough to help us through this world?  I also do trust my experiences to some extent.  When I do things that defy the seeming logic of my experience, because it is what my Father commands me to do, and I see the results in the long term, I find that He has led me in the proper direction, even though it did not feel right at the time.  This is where our works as Christians are important:  As exercises of the body make the body strong, excercises of faith make the faith strong.  As for you, no one can ""convert"" you.  You must choose to follow God of your own will, if you are ever to follow Him.  All we as Christians wish to do is share with you the love we have received from God.  If you reject that, we have to accept your decision, although we always keep the offer open to you.  If you really want to find out why we believe what we believe, I can only suggest you try praying for faith, reading the Bible, and asking Christians about their experiences personally.  Then you may grow to understand why we believe what we do, in defiance of the logic of this world.  May the Lord bring peace to you,  Malcusco "

Beyond that, I have no other info.  The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of the orbit of Mercury.  The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with Mercury.  But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915 and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's numbers rather than Leverrier's.)  Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.

""Judge not that ye be not judged.""  Strictly speaking, you're right - we can't repent _for_ somebody else, for what they've done.  I guess I don't think it's out of line to talk about a generalized repentence for our contribution to or participation in ""The sins of society"" , or for our tacit approval (by our silence) of sinful attitudes or practices....it may be that we're also just plain begging for mercy, hoping God will withhold his hand of judgement on our whole country for the sake of a few, much as Abraham sought to do for the sake of Lot.  (Hmmm, the results there were pretty cautionary...)  A few times lately when I've observed some either out-and-out sinful activity, or just some self-destructive activity, I've gotten a strong impression that many folks really don't know any better.  Christ's pity on the crowds as being ""like sheep without a shepherd"" rings true to me. If these folks don't have a clue, do I bear _any_ responsibility for my not having communicated a better way?  Worse still; have I expressed judgement and disgust at their doings, and thus alienated them from any positive relationship whereby I might pass along anything positive? I _know_ I've got something to repent about on that score.

Organization: University of Louisville Lines: 13  Undoubtedly people adopt atheism for many reasons, but I suspect that a biggie is that the God they've believed in is (in J.B. Phillips's words) ""too small"". If a person's understanding of God is not allowed to grow and develop, it will eventually become inadequate.  The grey-haired gentleman on a throne who was a comforting image in childhood becomes a joke.  A therapist friend of mine sometimes suggests to her clients that they ""fire God"".  What she means by that is letting go of an inadequate understanding of God to make room for a fuller one.  But she follows up by encouraging them to ""hire a new one"".  My guess is that a lot of folks go through the firing process, but are not adequately supported in the subsequent re-hire.  billh "

I not familiar with the ad you are speaking of but knowing Popular Science it is probably on the fringe.  However, you may be speaking of ""Public Missle, Inc."", which is a legitimate company that has been around for a while.

The engines range from D all the way to M in common manufacture, N and O I've heard of used at special occasions.

Amatuer rocketry is another area.  I'm not really familiar with this, but it is an area where metal parts are allowed, along with liquid fuels and what not.

Yes, they sign some (damned few -- which is why everyone is always having to go to Washington to see about next week's funding) multi-year contracts; they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it (which can happen arbitrarily at any time, no matter what previous plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a private space station with the government as the expected prime occupant.  I'd like a source for that statement about ""the reason they aren't cutting defense spending as much as they would like""; I just don't buy it. The other thing I find a bit 'funny' about your posting, Pat, is that several other people answered the question pretty much the same way I did; mine is the one you comment (and incorrectly, I think) on.

Quite likely, actually.  [...I believe ""Jesus only"" originally was in the context of baptism.  These are folks who believe that baptism should be done with a formula mentioning only Jesus, rather than Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  This may have doctrinal implications, but as far as I know it does not mean that these folks deny the existence or divinity of the Father.  I'm not the right one to describe this theology, and in fact I think there may be several, including what would classically be called monophysite or Arian (two rather different views), as well as some who have beliefs that are probably consistent with Trinitarian standards, but who won't use Trinitarian language because they misunderstand it or simply because it is not Biblical.  --clh]  Not Biblical?  What then can they make of the end of Matthew?  (28:18)And Jesus came and said to them, ""All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. (19)Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, (20) and teaching them to obey everything that I have commanded to you.  And remember, I am with you always, to the end of the age."" {Other ancient authorities add *Amen*} [NRSV]  The notes give no sense that this is emended.  Do other texts contradict this regarding Baptism?  Or is a misunderstanding of the Trinity the most likely explanation after all?  But maybe I simply misunderstand their views.  (Is anyone else out there forced to read this group with both a good Bible and an unabridged dictionary??  Christianity really is an education in itself.)  -- ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |David R. Tucker		KG2S		     drt@athena.mit.edu| ------------------------------------------------------------------------  [Arrgggghhhh.  When I talked about people who rejected Trinitarian language as unBiblical, I was speaking of Trinitarian theology, things like ""one essense and three persons"".  Obviously the three-fold baptismal formula is Biblical, as you point out.  (I normally use the term ""three-fold"" in referring to Mat.  While it is certainly consistent with belief in the Trinity, the Trinity is a doctrine whose full formulation occurred in the 4th and 5th Cent's.  It's unlikely that Mat. had in mind the fully-developed Trinitarian doctrine. Indeed the three-fold baptismal formula is used by some groups that do not believe in the Trinity.)  The disagreement over baptismal formulae occurs because of passages such as Acts 2:38, which command baptism in the name of Jesus.  (There are a couple of other passages in Acts as well.)  This leaves us with sort of a problem: we're commanded in Mat. to baptize in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, and in Acts to baptize in the name of Jesus.  ""Jesus only"" groups baptize in the name of Jesus.  They consider this consistent with Mat 28:18, because they say that Jesus is the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.  I'm not the right one to ask to explain what this means.  I will simply say that it does not appear to be normal Trinitarian theology.  (It is also an odd way of dealing with the idiomatic phrase ""in the name of"".)  Those who use the three-fold formula don't seem to have a standard answer to the passages talking about baptizing in the name of Jesus. I suspect that the most common explanation is to say that ""in the name of"" need not be a verbal formula.  To say that you baptize in the name of Jesus may simply mean that you are doing baptism under Jesus' authority.  In the 1st Cent. context, it contrasts Christian baptism with the baptism of John or other Jewish baptism.  Of course there's a certain parallelism between these passages.  That suggests that we could just as well say that Mat 28:18 doesn't require the specific three-fold formula to be used in baptism, but simply characterizes baptism done by those who follow the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.  One might well suspect that in the early church, more than one baptismal formula was used.  So long as we consider following Jesus to be the same as following the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, no great damage would be done by such a difference.  This does *not* mean that I think we should go back to using both formulae.  Baptism is one of the few things that almost all Christian groups now recognize mutually, so I do not think doing something to upset that would be in the interests of the Gospel.  This is reinforced by the fact that those groups that actually use ""in the name of Jesus"" now do seem to have in mind a difference in doctrine.  But as I've said before, I'm not the one to explain what their doctrine is.  --clh] "

soc.religion.christian	 From: mauaf@csv.warwick.ac.uk (Mr P D Simmons) Subject: Why religion and which religion? Organization: Computing Services, University of Warwick, UK Lines: 46   My family has never been particularly religious - singing Christmas carols is about the limit for them. Thus I've never really believed in God and heaven, although I don't actually believe that they don't exist either - I'm sort of undecided, probably like a lot of people I guess. Lately I've been thinking about it all a lot more, and I wondered how religious people can be so convinced that there is a God. I feel as though I want to believe, but I'm not used to believing things without proof - just as I can't believe that there definitely isn't a God, so I can't definitely believe that there is. I wondered if most of you were brought up by religious families and never believed any different. Can anyone help me to understand how your belief and faith in God can be so strong.  Another question that frequently crosses my mind is which religion is correct?? How do you choose a religion, and how do you know that the Christian God exists and the Gods of other religions don't?? How do you feel about people who follow other religions?? How about atheists?? And people like me - agnostics I suppose. Do you respect their religion, and accept their beliefs as just as valid as your own?? Isn't there contradiction between the religions?? How can your religion be more valid than any others?? Do you have less respect for someone if they're not religious, or if they follow a different religion than you would if they were Christian??  Also, how much of the scriptures are correct?? Are all events in the bible really supposed to have happened, or are they just supposed to be stories with morals showing a true Christian how to behave??  I generally follow most of the Christian ideas, which I suppose are fairly universal throughout all religions - not killing, stealing, etc, and 'Loving my neighbour' for want of a better expression. The only part I find hard is the actual belief in God.  Finally, what is God's attitude to people like me, who don't quite believe in Him, but are generally fairly 'good' people. Surely not believing doesn't make me a worse person?? If not, I find myself wondering why I so strongly want to really believe, and to find a religion.  Sorry if I waffled on a bit - I was just writing ideas as they came into my head. I'm sure I probably repeated myself a bit too.

Unfortunately your phrasing is ambiguous.  Re-writing more carefully, we have (at least) two possibilities.  The first:  Things called ""Mercedes"" are cars That girl is called ""Mercedes"" Therefore that girl is a car  That is entirely valid as a piece of logical deduction.

Blessed is the man whose iniquities are forgiven, whose sin is covered. (Ps. 32:1).  and quoted by the apostle Paul:  Even as David also describeth the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works, Saying, Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin.  (Rom. 4:6-8)  The biblical perspective seems to be that foregiveness and covering are parallel/equivalent concepts in both testaments.

I'm sure Rex has Scripture to back this up.  You're suggesting Jesus is going to travel around dealing with individual violations of His law -- for millions perhaps billions of people.

sci.space	" From: kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov Subject: Space Station Redesign, JSC Alternative #4 Organization: NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8] Lines: 71  I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.  Mark proposed this design, which he calls ""Geode"" (""rough on the outside, but a gem on the inside"") or the ""ET Strongback with integrated hab modules and centrifuge.""  As you can see from file geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS) pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass properties of the Station change during assembly.  The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the docking system.  The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit (contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to (performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember, it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.  The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we did with Skylab).  The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.  This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical, data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work done to date.  Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City, and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter seems more likely.  Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design; you should see his notes in the GIF files.  Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'll let you all know when I get that done.  -- Ken Jenks, NASA/JSC/GM2, Space Shuttle Program Office kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov  (713) 483-4368  ""...Development of the space station is as inevitable as the rising of the sun."" -- Wernher von Braun "

Will, there has been a lot of discussion going on about this over in s.r.c.b-s. I will make the case here though and try to help you out:  8 For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: 9 Not of works, lest any man should boast. (Ephesians 2:8-9).  Yes, it is by God's grace and our faith that we are saved.  We are not saved by what we do.  However,  15 If ye love me, keep my commandments. (John 14:15).  Keeping Christ's commandments is a ""work"" per se, and a demonstration of our love for him.  Also,  6 He spake also this parable; A certain man had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came and sought fruit thereon, and found none. 7 Then said he unto the dresser of his vineyard, Behold, these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree, and find none: cut it down; why cumbereth it the ground? 8 And he answering said unto him, Lord, let it alone this year also, till I shall dig about it, and dung it: 9 And if it bear fruit, well: and if not, then after that thou shalt cut it down. (Luke 13:6-9).  Again,  16 Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you. (John 15:16).  It is clear from these verses that we are called to bring forth fruit. What is that fruit.  Well, Paul speaks of the fruit of the spirit being love, joy, peace, patience, etc.  All of these are things that are manifest in the actions that we carry out.  If a person claims to believe in Jesus Christ, but does not do the things Christ commanded, I dare say, that they really don't have any faith. Asking which is more important, faith or works, is like asking which blade on a pair of scissors is most important or like asking which leg of your pants is more important.  Good works should come out of and be a result of our faith.  To have faith, true faith in Christ requires you to do what he commands.  The parable above speaks allegorically of a person who does bear no fruit.  Christs commands are actions, and if we don't do those actions and produce fruit, then we shall be uprooted just like the tree.  It is a dead and useless faith which has no action behind it.  Actions prove our faith and show the genuineness of it.  I can sit and talk for days about the fact that I have so much faith in my ability to jump off a building and not hit the ground.  In other words, I can sit and tell you all day long that I have faith in my ability to fly.  I really don't have that faith though unless I am willing to jump off the roof and take the test.  Words and talk mean nothing.  I could go on and give more scriptures and if people want me to I will, but this should be sufficient.  Hope it helped.

A good introductory book (in fact one of the best introductory books to Islam in general) is Murtaza Mutahhari's ""Fundamental's of Islamic Thought - God, Man, and the Universe"" - Mizan Press, translated by R. Campbell. Truly a beautiful book. A follow-up book (if you can find a decent translation) is ""Wilaya - The Station of the Master"" by the same author. I think it also goes under the title of ""Master and Mastership"" - It's a very small book - really just a transcription of a lecture by the author. The introduction to the beautiful ""Psalms of Islam"" - translated by William C. Chittick (available through Muhammadi Trust of Great Britain) is also an excellent introduction to the subject. We have these books in our University library - I imagine any well stocked University library will have them.  From your posts, you seem fairly well versed in Sunni thought. You should seek to know Shi'ite thought through knowledgeable Shi'ite authors as well - at least that much respect is due before the charge of heresy is levelled.  As salaam a-laikum "

If the code was once perfect, and has degraded ever since, we _should_ have some evidence in favour of this statement, shouldn't we?  Perhaps the biggest ""imperfection"" of the code is that it is full of non-coding regions, introns, which are so called because they intervene with the coding regions (exons). An impressive amount of evidence suggests that introns are of very ancient origin; it is likely that early exons represented early protein domains.  Is the number of introns decreasing or increasing? It appears that intron loss can occur, and species with common ancestry usually have quite similar exon-intron structure in their genes.  On the other hand, the possibility that introns have been inserted later, presents several logical difficulties. Introns are removed by a splicing mechanism - this would have to be present, but unused, if introns are inserted. Moreover, intron insertion would have required _precise_ targeting - random insertion would not be tolerated, since sequences for intron removal (self-splicing of mRNA) are conserved. Besides, transposition of a sequence usually leaves a trace - long terminal repeats and target - site duplications, and these are not found in or near intron sequences.  I seriously recommend reading textbooks on molecular biology and genetics before posting ""theological arguments"" like this. Try Watson's Molecular Biology of the Gene or Darnell, Lodish & Baltimore's Molecular Biology of the Cell for starters.  : Remember, the question was posed in a theological context (Why does : God cause disease in newborns?), and my answer is likewise from a : theological perspective -- my own.  It is no less valid than a purely : scientific perspective, just different.  Scientific perspective is supported by the evidence, whereas theological perspectives often fail to fulfil this criterion.  : I think you misread my meaning.  I said God made the genetic code perfect, : but that doesn't mean it's perfect now.  It has certainly evolved since.  For the worse? Would you please cite a few references that support your assertion? Your assertion is less valid than the scientific perspective, unless you support it by some evidence.  In fact, it has been claimed that parasites and diseases are perhaps more important than we've thought - for instance, sex might have evolved as defence against parasites. (This view is supported by computer simulations of evolution, eg Tierra.)  : Perhaps.  I thought it was higher energy rays like X-rays, gamma : rays, and cosmic rays that caused most of the damage.  In fact, it is thermal energy that does most of the damage, although it is usually mild and easily fixed by enzymatic action.  : Actually, neither of us ""knows"" what the atmosphere was like at the : time when God created life.  According to my recollection, most : biologists do not claim that life began 4 billion years ago -- after : all, that would only be a half billion years or so after the earth : was created.  It would still be too primitive to support life.  I : seem to remember a figure more like 2.5 to 3 billion years ago for : the origination of life on earth.  Anyone with a better estimate?  I'd replace ""created"" with ""formed"", since there is no need to invoke any creator if the Earth can be formed without one. Most recent estimates of the age of the Earth range between 4.6 - 4.8 billion years, and earliest signs of life (not true fossils, but organic, stromatolite-like layers) date back to 3.5 billion years. This would leave more than billion years for the first cells to evolve.  I'm sorry I can't give any references, this is based on the course on evolutionary biochemistry I attended here.  : >>dominion, it was no great feat for Satan to genetically engineer : >>diseases, both bacterial/viral and genetic.  Although the forces of : >>natural selection tend to improve the survivability of species, the : >>degeneration of the genetic code tends to more than offset this.  Again, do you _want_ this be true, or do you have any evidence for this supposed ""degeneration""?

I hope you don't forget this: We have _evidence_ that suggests everything can come about spontaneously. Do you have evidence against this conclusion? In science, one does not have to _believe_ in anything. It is a healthy sign to doubt and disbelieve. But the right path to walk is to take a look at the evidence if you do so, and not to present one's own conclusions prior to this.  Theology does not use this method. Therefore, I seriously doubt it could ever come to right conclusions.  : >>Human DNA, being more ""complex"", tends to accumulate errors adversely : >>affecting our well-being and ability to fight off disease, while the : >>simpler DNA of bacteria and viruses tend to become more efficient in : >>causing infection and disease.  It is a bad combination.  Hence : >>we have newborns that suffer from genetic, viral, and bacterial : >>diseases/disorders.  You are supposing a purpose, not a valid move. Bacteria and viruses do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifests of a general principle of evolution - only replication saves replicators from degradiation. We are just an efficient method for our DNA to survive and replicate. The less efficient methods didn't make it to the present.  And for the last time.  Please present some evidence for your claim that human DNA is degrading through evolutionary processes. Some people have claimed that the opposite is true - we have suppressed our selection, and thus are bound to degrade. I haven't seen much evidence for either claim.  : But then I ask, So?  Where is this relevant to my discussion in : answering John's question of why?  Why are there genetic diseases, : and why are there so many bacterial and viral diseases which require : babies to develop antibodies.  Is it God's fault? (the original : question) -- I say no, it is not.  Of course, nothing ""evil"" is god's fault.  But your explanation does not work, it fails miserably.  : You may be right.  But the fact is that you don't know that : Satan is not responsible, and neither do I. : : Suppose that a powerful, evil being like Satan exists.  Would it : be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ills : that affect mankind?  I don't think so.  He could have done a much better Job. (Pun intended.) The problem is, it seems no Satan is necessary to explain any diseases, they are just as inevitable as any product of evolution.  : Did I say that?  Where?  Seems to me like another bad inference. : Actually what you've done is to oversimplify what I said to the : point that your summary of my words takes on a new context.  I : never said that people are ""meant"" (presumably by God) ""to be : punished by getting diseases"".  Why I did say is that free moral : choices have attendent consequences.  If mankind chooses to reject : God, as people have done since the beginning, then they should not : expect God to protect them from adverse events in an entropic : universe.  I am not expecting this. If god exists, I expect him to leave us alone. I would also like to hear why do you believe your choices are indeed free. This is an interesting philosophical question, and the answer is not as clear-cut as it seems to be.  What consequences would you expect from rejecting Allah?  : Oh, I admit it's not perfect (yet).  But I'm working on it.  :)  A good library or a bookstore is a good starting point.  : What does this have to do with the price of tea in China, or the : question to which I provided an answer?  Biology and Genetics are : fine subjects and important scientific endeavors.  But they explain : *how* God created and set up life processes.  They don't explain : the why behind creation, life, or its subsequent evolution.  Why is there a ""why behind""? And your proposition was something that is not supported by the evidence. This is why we recommend these books.  Is there any need to invoke any why behind, a prime mover? Evidence for this? If the whole universe can come into existence without any intervention, as recent cosmological theories (Hawking et al) suggest, why do people still insist on this?  : Thanks Scotty, for your fine and sagely advice.  But I am : not highly motivated to learn all the nitty-gritty details : of biology and genetics, although I'm sure I'd find it a : fascinating subject.  For I realize that the details do : not change the Big Picture, that God created life in the : beginning with the ability to change and adapt to its : environment.  I'm sorry, but they do. There is no evidence for your big picture, and no need to create anything that is capable of adaptation. It can come into existence without a Supreme Being.  Try reading P.W.

Your using 20th century concepts to interprete 1st century writers.  Of course, in your termonology, God could not ""cease to exist.""  However, that is not what death ever means in the Scriptures.  If you will study the word, you will see that it signifies ""separation.""  Death is separation, not ceastation.  This is the reason for the agony of the cross.  For the first time in eternity, one member of the Godhead was separated from the other two.  I once met a young lady that was as beautiful as any model that ever lived. She was as personable as any saint ever imagined.  She was to become my ""girlfriend"" for several years.  However, having been drafted, we were separated by distance.  To me that was a form of death.  Later, she decided that she couldn't wait for me to come home and bid me adue.  That to me was death.  It was separation from that which had made me whole.  Death is separation and eternal death is eternal separation from His fellowship, not because He chose to send you into outer darkness, but because you chose to go there.  >> did you know that Jesus talked more >> about hell than He did about heaven!  >Thank you for this info.

When I rebelled against my earthly father, he spanked me.  I found no wisdom in that until I had grown older and especially until I had my own children.  He was trying to guide me away from hurt that would enter my life if I continued on my suicidal course.  He did it in love though I interpreted it as harsh and unloving.  If God warns of impending danger, that is love.  If choose to let us do as we please, and then at the end tell us the rules, that would be harsh. You have a conscience, no matter how calused or fallen it is, that witnesses to you that a thing is wrong and that there is cause for fear.  >Being Jesus was allegedly God, I doubt he could honestly feel >     the pinpricks man dealt him...  This may give light to the error of your understanding.  One must have correct knowledge in order to have correct faith.  Faith and knowledge are inseparable. Jesus most certainly felt the ""pinpricks"" of life.  As the Scripture say:  Heb. 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all things as we are, yet without sin.  The kenosis passage of Phil 2 states that He gave up His Godhead attributes when He took upon Himself humanity.  It has been a favorite meditation of mine to think about this.  It was to be my PhD thesis.  ""The Consciousness of Christ.""  I have talked at length with a great many people about this interesting study, including clh.  It is my conclussion that as Jesus, the 2nd member of the Trinity, actually suffered as we do.  He became part of the human race and experienced it as we do.  He ""grew in knowledge.""  He chose not to grasp His omniscience, but chose to be taught.  It is my understanding that He was ""led of the Spirit"" to such an extent that sometimes it is hard to distinquish between Jesus the man and Jesus as God.  But in Jn 8 where the adulterous women was thrown before Him, the tenses are quite clear in that the whole situation took Him by surprise. That is, He was not aware that this event was to take place in time.  He was living sequential history as you or I.  Maybe some other time we can discuss this, but it is a very lengthy discussion and one that causes the curcuit breakers of the brain to pop more often than not.  >Thanks again for the info.  Just so you know, some friends and I >     are starting a Freethinkers organization-- and I'm going to >     use some of the info you provided for an organization intro- >     duction... :-)  I was once a member of that club.  THe ""free thinker"" is a glorious ideal.  By contrast, of course, you believe that the believer is the unforunate repository of everything that is dogmatic, inhibited, reactionary and repressive.  I find such a stance to be as amusing as it is absurd.   If the liberal humanist wishes to criticize a Christian or a Buddhist or a Marxist, that is his right. But what he must not pretend is that he was led to this solely by his ""rational doubt"" when in fact he was led to it by his ""faith"".  He must acknowledge that while it is rational doubt for him as a ""free thinker"" to criticize the Christian, it might equally be a rational doubt for the Christian to criticize him as a humanist.  If there is no faith, there can be no dout.  There is no faith which cannot choose to cast doubt on some other faith.  Pascal pointed out that ""sceptical arguments allow the positive to be positive. Few. . .speak dubiously of scepticism.""  The fact that skeptics are not skeptical about skepticism is further evidence that to doubt anything we must believe in something else!  THe person who is skeptical toward one faith or even most faiths, will be the devoted adherent of another.  In fact, it is a measure of his poverty both that he is unaware of it and that he can define himself only in negative terms, hence the term ""a""-theist.  Some people claim otherwise and argue vociferously for complete skepticism.  In my campus ministry I ran across this more times than I care to remember. However, they disproved their own argument with every thought, every word, every point of logic that they used.  Every moment of shared communication speaks against their total skepticism.  Their very insistence of trying to make sense is eloquent testimony to assumptions that are powerful though silent.  That is to say, that complete skepticism is impossible and limited skepticism is arbitrary.  Next time you're in a room of skeptics, yell out ""Look, your fly is undone!""  Each person chooses what he is skeptical about and what he believes without skepticism.  To stress this is to belabor the obvious, but it underlines the point that no one can know exhaustively how he knows what he knows.  Pure objectivism is a myth and complete skepticism an impossiblity. The answer to this impasse lies in  a 3rd way of knowing, one which is based on presuppositions.  But if knowledge proceeds on what must be presupposed before it is proved, the cover is blown on the pretentions of critical doubt, and critical doubt depends on the idea that human knowledge is totally objective and neutral.  In other words, another myth.  Presuppositions my friend.  It is impossible to doubt anything unless there is something we do not doubt -our own assumptions/presuppostions.  Even these can be criticezed only upon the basis of other assumptions.  Presuppostitons are our silent partners in thought but their silence must not be mistaken for absence.  >  I tell you what-- if God condemns me for being honest, He is >    unworthy of my worship.

You are operating off of a presuppositional premise of humanistic theology, not what He has revealed of Himself through history, through His prophets, through His Word, and lastly, but most of all, thru His Son.

For a first-time encounter, my *personal* preference would be to deal with a textbook written in my native language.  But if you know German and are in Germany, pick up all the reference books you think you can handle.  (I only know these works by reputation, since my German is most rusty, but I'd look at the following books: Koehler's lexicon, Mandeldern's concordance, the Jenni & Westermann theological dictionary of the OT.)  > What's it like at divinity schools or seminaries in the States?  Is > there a lot of language instruction done?  I really don't have a basis > for comparison.  The amount of language instruction available at US seminaries varies widely, mostly depending on the denominational heritage of the school.  Presbyterian and Reformed seminaries probably place a lot more emphasis on the biblical languages than others.  (Of course, any divinity school that has a doctoral program in biblical studies is going to have extensive language resources!  But there are quite a few masters-degree-granting seminaries here at which the attitude seems to be more, ""Well, if you're *really* interested we'll give you a semester-long course, but we don't understand why . . ."")  The pattern here at the Louisville Presbyterian Seminary is for first-year students to take intensive five-week introductory language courses in each language, followed by semester-long exegesis courses.  (That is: Hebrew in August, OT exegesis in the fall; Greek in January, NT exegesis in the spring.) These courses are required for graduation, a third or a half of the students, I'd say, take advanced biblical work that requires language work. "

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions. However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can always hide a sufficiently small number of a different type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming that there is only one population of GRBs).  The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.  If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy) you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center (for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.  >my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering >hyperspace :-)  The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.  >but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they >are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered >if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

And yet, Jayne,  as we read the Gospels and in particular the topics that Jesus himself spoke on, Hell figures in a large % of the time -certainly more than heaven itself.  Paul, as we learn in I Thess, taught new believers and new churches eschatology and did not hesitate to teach hell and damnation.  Rev, chapter 20:11-15 is very specific and cannot be allegorized.  I think the word ""throne"" is used 45 times in Rev and that the unbelieving come to receive the assignment of the severity of judgement, for in John 3 we read that they are already judged.  Rom 3 speaks that every mouth will be shut.

Preaching the Gospel >without living the Gospel is no better than being a noisy gong or a >clanging cymbal.  Yes I agree with you.  Life is often like a pendulum where it swings to extremes before stopping at ""moderation.""  I think we have seen the extreme of the ""hell fire & brimstone"" preacher, but also we have seen the other extreme where hell not talked about at all for fear of offending someones sensibilities.  I forget who founded the Word of Life Ministries, but I remember him telling a story.  He was in a small town hardware store and some how a man got to the point of telling him that he didn't believe in Satan or hell.  He believed everybody was going to heaven.  It was at this point that the man was asked to pray to God that He would send his children to hell!  Of course the man wouldn't do it.  But the point was made.  Many people say they don't believe in hell but they are not willing to really place their faith in that it doesn't exist.  If this man had, he would of prayed the prayer because hell didn't exist and there would have been no fear in having his prayer answered.  And yet, they walk as if they believe they will never be sent there.  I'd use a different illustration however.  I have to include myself in it. When I watch, say a Basketball (go Bulls!) game, and I see a blatant foul that isn't called, oi vey!.  What's with that ref that he didn't make that call. It's unfair.  And just so in life, righteousness demands payment.  As the surgeon takes knife in hand to cut the cancer away, so God cuts off that which is still of the old creation.  We must preach the Gospel in all its richness which includes the fact that if you reject The Way and The Truth and The Life, then broad is the way to distruction.  > >Here's a question:  How many of you are Christians because you are >afraid of going to Hell?  How many are responding to God's love?  I think I would fall in there somewhere.  Actually it was both.  After all, repentance isn't only a turning towards, but also a turning away from! No, again, if Jesus used it in His ministry then I can surely see that we should do it also.  In love, of course, but in truth most assuredly.  I have thought about writing something on this topic, but not now and here.  I would say that there are some good reasons for its existence and its eternality.  1) God is Light.  Yes He is love, but His love has the boundary of Holiness. 2) Dignity of Man.  Either a man is a robot or he is a responsible creature. If responsible, then he is also accountable. 3) The awfulness of sin.  Today we have a poor, poor concept of sin & God. 4) Christ.

The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km -- the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course, you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.  The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit. For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way.  Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which dominates the cost of the project. -- All work is one man's work.             | Henry Spencer @ U of Toronto Zoology - Kipling           |  henry@zoo.toronto.edu  utzoo!henry

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a ""we have the money, why not?"" approach.  It's conceivable that Luna will have a military purpose, it's possible that Luna will have a commercial purpose, but it's most likely that Luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least. Therefore, Lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for Antarctic bases. Can you put a 200 person base on the Moon for $30 million a year?

I finished reading a very good book, ""The Will of God"", Weatherhead. This was very helpful to me in applying thought to the subject of the will of God.  Weatherhead broke the will of God into three distinct parts; intentional will, circumstancial will, and ultimate will.  He (Weatherhead) also refuted the last statement (above) by Michael Parkin above quite nicely.  Summarizing; _despite_ the failures of humankind, God's ultimate will is never to be defeated.  God's intentions may be interfered with, even temporarily defeated by the will of humankind, brought down by circumstance.  His ultimate will (the reconcilication of all humankind) will never be stopped.  Time after time, Weatherhead used the Cross as the best description of this process at work.  His points, paraphrased, were 1) God's intentional will was for Jesus, the Christ, to live out a full life and perform the work of the Living God.  2) The failures, sins, and deviousness of humankind frustrated God's intent for His Son.  3) Despite the circumstance, God's ultimate will was revealed in the Cross, as Jesus willingly (""not my will, Lord, but yours"") died for the redemption of all humankind.  The Cross was utterly triumphant, overcoming even the most cruel of circumstances.  >this world to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.

How many optical astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?  3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of 'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)? The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing.  4) If your answer to 3) above was ""the astronomers"", then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.

I *did* become a Christian without having been indoctrinated by my parents, and having studied Buddhism fairly carefully and other religions to a lesser degree.  I made a decision to accept the truth-claims of Christianity after having given it a lot of thought.  (I have to point out that the process was not purely a cold, rational one: there was a powerful experiential element as well. Also, my Calvinist should rest assured that I don't lay any of the responsibility for the outcome [my conversion] on anyone but God.)  It took me years and years for this all to happen, because I had many of the objections that this poster puts forward.  I grew up in the shadow of [generic authoritarian conservative denomination], and I *knew* that that wasn't a way of life that I could adopt.  But I gradually learned not to tar all of Christianity with the same brush, and realized quite suddenly one cold winter night that I accepted what I had heretofore rejected.  I am quite certain that I was not ""brain-washed"".  bill hovingh "

It is clear that Mr. Wingate intends to continue to post tangential or unrelated articles while ingoring the Challenges themselves.  Between the last two re-postings of the Challenges, I noted perhaps a dozen or more posts by Mr. Wingate, none of which answered a single Challenge.  It seems unmistakable to me that Mr. Wingate hopes that the questions will just go away, and he is doing his level best to change the subject.  Given that this seems a rather common net.theist tactic, I would like to suggest that we impress upon him our desire for answers, in the following manner:  1. Ignore any future articles by Mr. Wingate that do not address the Challenges, until he answers them or explictly announces that he refuses to do so.  --or--  2. If you must respond to one of his articles, include within it something similar to the following:  ""Please answer the questions posed to you in the Charley Challenges.""

soc.religion.christian	" From: JEK@cu.nih.gov Subject: When are two people married Lines: 128  LISTOWNER: I have sent this to Mr Anderson privately. Post it only if you think it of general interest.  Here is a copy of something I wrote for another list. You may find it relevant.  A listmember asks:  > What makes common-law marriages wrong?  A common-law marriage is not necessarily wrong in itself. There is nothing in the Bible (Old or New Testament) about getting married by a preacher, or by a priest (Jewish or Christian). And in fact Jewish priests have never had any connection with weddings.  There is a common notion that the marriage is performed by the clergyman. In fact, the traditional Christian view (at least in the West) is that the bride and groom are the ministers of the marriage, and that the clergyman is there only as a witness.  HOWEVER!  The essential ingredient of a marriage is mutual commitment. Two persons are considered to be married if and only if they have bound themselves by mutual promises to live together as husband and wife, forsaking all others, till death do them part.  The reason why those who have reason to be concerned about who is married to whom have always insisted on some kind of public ceremony is in order that society, and the couple themselves, may be clear about whether a commitment has been made.  Suppose that we do away with the public ceremony, the standard vows, etc. Instead, we have a man and a woman settling down to live together. After a year or so, the man says to the woman: Hey, honey, it was great while it lasted, but I think it's time to move on. She says: What are you talking about? He says: I am leaving you and looking for someone prettier and younger. She says: But you can't. We are married! He says: What are you talking about? We never got married. She says: I remember distinctly what you said to me the night we first made love. You said: ""My love for you is as deep as the ocean, as eternal as the stars. As long as I live, I am yours, utterly and completely. When I lie on my deathbed, my last feeble breath will utter your name. My..."" He says: Oh that! That was just rhetoric. Just poetry. When a man is in a romantic mood, he is bound to say all kinds of silly things like that. You mustn't take them literally.  And that is why you have an insistence on a formal ceremony that is a matter of public record. The Church insists on it, because it is her duty (among other things) to give moral advice, and you cannot give a man moral advice about his relations with a woman if you have no idea who is married to whom, if anybody, and vice versa. The State insists on it, since the state has a concern with property rights, with child care and support, and therefore needs to know who has made what commitments to whom. Prospective fathers-in-law insist on it, because they don't want their daughters seduced and abandoned. Prospective spouses insist on it, because they want to make sure they know whether what they are hearing is a real commitment, or just ""poetry."" And persons making vows themselves insist on making them formally and publicly, in order that they may be clear in their own minds about what it is that they are doing, and may know themselves that this is not just rhetoric. This is the real thing.  Hence the insistence on a formal public explicit avowal of the marriage commitment.  The Church goes further and insists that, when Christians marry, a clergyman shall be present at the wedding and record the vows on behalf of the Church, not because it is impossible to have a valid wedding without a clergyman, but in order to make sure that the couple understand what the Christian teaching about marriage is, and that they are in fact promising to be married in a Christian sense. The Church also prefers a standard marriage vow, and is wary of letting couples Write their own vows, for much the same reason that lawyers prefer standard terminology when they draw up a will or a contract. Certain language has been repeatedly used in wills, and one can be sure how the courts will interpret it. Try to say the same thing in your own words, and you may find that the probate judge's interpretation of them is not at all what you intended.  Similarly, the Church prefers to avoid endless debates about whether ""You are my main squeeze"" and ""I am here for the long haul"" do in fact cover the same territory as ""forsaking all others"" and ""till death do us part.""  This topic has come up on the list before. (Is there any topic that hasn't?) One listmember was asking, ""If a couple love each other and are living together, isn't that marriage in the eyes of God?"" Eventually someone asked, ""In that case, what is their status if they break up? Is that the moral equivalent of getting a divorce? Are they in a relationship that God forbids either of them to walk out on? "" The original questioner said: ""Good grief, I never thought of that!"" In fact, there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that someone who says, ""We don't need a piece of paper or a ceremony in front of a judge or a preacher in order to show that we love each other,"" is trying to have it both ways -- to have the advantages of marriage plus the option of changing his mind with a minimum of bother.  At this point someone may say, ""None of this applies to me and my mate. We are quite clear on the fact that we have assumed a lifelong commitment, 'for better or worse, forsaking all others, till death us do part.' So in our case, no ceremony is needed."" To this my reply would be: The reason for requiring a driver's license is to keep dangerous drivers off the road.  What is wrong in itself is not the existence of unlicensed drivers, but the existence of dangerous drivers. However, testing and licensing drivers is an obvious and reasonable means of pursuing the goal of reducing the number of dangerous drivers on the road. Therefore the State rightly makes and enforces such laws, and you the citizen have a positive moral obligation to refrain from driving without a license no matter how much of a hotshot behind the wheel you think you are.  Back to the original question. We have a listmember who knows a couple who have been living together for around 20 years. He asks: At what point did they stop fornicating and start being married? I answer: at the point, if any, where they both definitely and explicitly accepted an obligation to be faithful to each other, for better or worse, as long as they both lived. If they have accepted such an obligation, what are their reasons for not being willing to declare it in front of, say, a justice of the peace?  Yours, James Kiefer "

I would first like to thank each and every person who sent me a response (be it a positive or negative one). I read EVERY letter and thought about each one!!  I got all sorts of responses, from ""marry her"" to ""have nothing ever to do with her again""  Through reading the Bible and through a lot of prayer, here is what I have decided to do.  I sent her a letter today. First, i told her that if she was really serious about moving away from home to another state that ""I would do anything to get you here in NC."" I told her that I tried to find out if there were any new stores planning to be built---but they wouldn't tell me.  About her marraige comment (I'm not gonna call it a proposal, cause I still don't know if it was a total joke or not) I more or less said that ""Marry me?? Well, get transferred to NC first and then we'll talk :) :)""  Hopefully, what i said could be interpreted either way.  Needless to say, there has been a lot of praying over this...I have done a lot of reading about marraige from the Bible. If she was dead serious about getting married---I wouldn't do it yet simply b/c she is not (as far as I know to this point) a Christian. It just wouldn't work w/o God in the marraige as well. I figure that if God wanrs this to go through--he's kept us in touch for 10 years now---he can handle one more. If God wants it to happen, it will happen!  She will be in NC in June meetinf some relatives so I'll get to see her...and I'll get a letter from her befoe then so I know more of what to look forward to.  I guess all I can do now is wait and pray. I have decided not to tell my folks until I'm totally sure what is going on.  I do ask that everyone that wrote me to please keep this situation in your prayers..  Finally, I would like to thank EVERYONE who wrote in...  If you have anything else for me...I will be at this email address for one week. Please tell me anyhting you want...I'm curious how folks think about what i did.   Thanx  Chris "

In general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent between these networks, and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special 'servers'.  The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.  One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below.  A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a 'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro', and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called 'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted.  Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the preferred option.  MAILING LISTS  SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the International Space University (in only its second change of management in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README for further details.  Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.  GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.  Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.  Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics; discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech, or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.  SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and Development of Space and other interested parties. Email LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your name"". Email saying ""INDEX SEDS-L"" to list the archive contents.  SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name"" to join. Email saying ""INDEX SEDSNEWS"" to list the archive contents.  Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him to join the list.  As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate 'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list address rather than the request address.  PERIODICALLY UPDATED INFORMATION  In addition to this FAQ list, a broad variety of topical information is posted to the net (unless otherwise noted, in the new group sci.space.news created for this purpose). Please remember that the individuals posting this information are performing a service for all net readers, and don't take up their time with frivolous requests.

Actually, the idea, like most good ideas, comes from Jules Verne, not _The Gods Must Be Crazy._  In one of his lesser known books (I can't remember which one right now), the protagonists are in a balloon gondola, travelling over Africa on their way around the world in the balloon, when one of them drops a fob watch.  They then speculate about the reaction of the natives to finding such a thing, dropped straight down from heaven. But the notion is not pursued further than that.  -Scott --------------------                          New .sig under construction Scott I.

Thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure. The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant, so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant.

The gravity data is collected in real-time and it not recorded to the tape recorder.  However, you only need to collect the gravity every 3rd or 4th orbit, so there is no real data loss if the Moon blocks transmission for a short while.  >BTW: When will NASA cut off the connection with Magellan??

A Christian woman hires a carpenter to build her a birdhouse.  When he comes over, they begin talking about religion.  ""So you believe that you understand God?"" he asks.  ""Yes, I do,"" she replies.  ""Then have him build you the birdhouse.""  I don't think that Melinda is complaining about the basis of Christian belief.  However, there is a tendency among Christians to say, ""I have all the answers because God gave them to me.""  This is simply not the case. I believe that the Bible is inerrant.  However, our HUMAN interpretations of the Bible are necessarily in error, because we are human and imperfect.  We have to remember that we ALL make mistakes in faith, and that because we are human we have an imperfect understanding of the mind and will of God.  To claim, as so many people do, that the existence of the Bible allows us to determine the answers to all questions is to claim that we humans can fully understand God's will.  This is hubris. "

I've got a problem that I need as many people's help from as possible.  Before I go in to the details of this, let me go ahead and tell you that (though it may sound it) this is not one of those boy meets girl problem...at least not totally like that to me....Anyway...  OK, I am a 19 year old Sophmore at NCSU. About 10 years ago, my family and I were vacationing at the coast in a cottage we rented. Across the street, was ths girl who would whistle at me whenever she saw me... her name in Erin. Well, we became friends that week at the beach and have been writing each other for about 10 years....there was a period of about 2 years we lost contact..but that was a while ago.  By the way...Erin lives in Kansas and me in NC.  OK, last year in one of her letters, she says that she is coming back to NC to see some of her family who are gonna be there. So I drove about 4 hours to see her. This is where it begins....I spent the whole day with Erin....one of the best days of my life. Even though we had been writing each other, we still had to get used to being in person....she has got to be the most incredible woman I ever met. (She's one year older than me BTW). I mean, no person in the world could ask for a better person. Not only was she incredibly beautiful (not to mention WAY out of my league...although I'm  not unattractive mind you), but she had a great personality and a great sence of humor. Her family is one of those families who goes to church but that is about the extent of their Christianity...you know the kind of people. But she knows I am a Christian.  Well, you get the idea of what I think of her. If there is ever such a thing as love at first sight....I found it. That was last year...I kid you not when I say that I have thought about her EVERY day since then.  In out letters, Erin and I always kid each other about not finding dates..(which is true for me, but I know it can't be for her). She has had some problems at home, her folks split up and she ended up leaving school....Now we are at the present...  Let me give you part of the letter I got from her last week....   ""Okay, now I'm going to try to explain my life to you. I'm not going to KU anymore because something just isn't right. College just wasn't clicking with me here. Greek life is really big here and that just isn't my way. I wasn't taking any classes that truly interested me & i really have no idea of what i want to do with my life. I was interested in something medical (Physical Therpy) & I love working with kids, but 'it' just didn't work for me at this university. And my parents could tell.  ""So I'm working full time at the Bass Store [Bass shoes that is] and now I have a part-time job at a local daycare. I work in the infant room M-W-F. I've really enjoyed it so far. It spices up my week a little bit and it's great experience.  ""As of now, I'm not planning on going back to school in the very near future. The main reason being my indecision on what I want to study. But I definatley plan on going back within the next couple of years. Where? I have no idea--except for one thing, it won't be to Kansas.  ""Right noew I'm discussing a promotion with my boss and district manager. It looks like I'll train at the store I work at now for about 4-6 months as Assistant Manager and when that's done, I'll basically be given a list of stores (newly or soon to be built) to chose where i would like to manage. I've pretty much decided on either one of the Carolinas (hopeully close to the beach) Wouldn't it be fun to actually see each other more than once every few years?? What do you think abou that? I would like to know your opinion.  ""This job would pretty much be temporary. But it is VERY GOOD pay and any thye of management experience would look good on an application or resume. The company is solid and treats it employees very well. Good benefits, bonuses & medical plans. Plus- after 1 year of full-time service, they will reimburse tuition. I do have school money waitng for me, but this will help, especially since I will probably end up paying out of state tuition wherever I go.  ""Chris, i really would like to know what you think of my decision. I respect your opinion. I've been completely lost for what to do for soooo long that when the opportunity came along it sounded really good. I do like my job although I'm about 99.9% sure that i want to do more with my life than reatil management..but it IS something. I don't think earning about $20,000 a year for a 20 year old female is too bad.  ""Anyway, onto your career decisions. I'll solve your problem right now, MARRY ME...  ""You can do your pilot thing-- I like to be by myself sometimes! Seriously (or not as seriously)- do what will make you the happiest, worry about the home life later.""  ***********  OK, well I'm sure you see what has got me so uptight. What do you think she meant about the marraige thing??  I dream at night about marrying her, and then she mentions it in her letter!!! I don't know what to think??  Since she wants to move to the Carolina's should i search out a Bass store near here and aske her to come to Carolina???  I always pick on those people who graduate from high school and get married....but what does she mean???  I've had a lot of stress lately with exams and also the fact that I don't date beacause 1) No time  2) Not that much $$ 3) that most college women are wrapped up in the social scene with  the Greeks whic as a Christian I can't support-----and here she says she doesn't like the Greek thing either!!  Maybe I'm so stunned because there is actually a girl that I am so attracted to paying some real attention to me.  I mean, what if she did move to NC...what would I do??? I'm only 19 and she 20....I'm only a Sophmore struggling through classes..  I have prayed about this over the past year from time to time.. saying, ""God if she is the right one, let the situation open up..""  Could this be my sign???  I would do ANYTHING to get her to NC...here is some moree that makes it worse..  Should I call her?? I'm terrible over the phone.

Christianity is not the cause of the massacres and horrific injustices that you relate, rather they are the fault of people who misunderstand Jesus Christ's message, and modify it to suit their own beliefs and aims, rather than alter their ambitions to be more in line with those presented as desirable in the New Testament.  With every truthful and good message that carries authority or implied authority, comes the inevitable fact that some (many?) people will understand it in a distorted way, with inevitable consequences.  The Bible's message is that we are to love all people, and that all people are redeemable.  It preaches a message of repentance, and of giving.  Unfortunately, all people have deceitful hearts, and are capable of turning this message around and contorting it in sometimes unbelievable ways. This is also a fundamental Christian doctrine.  One of the problems is that you look at the world through the eyes of Western history.  I think that you will find many, many cases of massacres that were instigated by people who never claimed they were Christian.  I am not saying this to justify the massacres that were, but I am merely pointing you to a tendency which is present in humans already.  Consider the world without Christianity.  I doubt that we would have the same freedoms in the countries in which we live, if it wasn't for the peaceful doctrines of Jesus Christ. Perhaps we would even be confronted by a very harsh religion (I won't name any here, though one comes to mind) which would not even allow us the freedom of speech to debate such subjects.  Point the blame at inherent human tendencies of thirst for power, greed and hatred.  Please don't point the blame at a message which preaches fundamental giving and denial, in love for others.  Yours in Christ,  Andrew McVeigh   p.s. I believe that a line of questioning like you presented is, strangely enough, compatible with becoming a Christian. Certainly Christianity encourages one to question the behaviour of the world, and especially Christians.  I praise God for Jesus Christ, and the fact that we can doubt our beliefs and still come back to God and be forgiven, time and time again.  -- *****   Andrew McVeigh "

Verses: 1 Corinthians 6:9-10 Colossians 3:5-10  As for knowing when, that's a bit tricky.  People normally have consciences which warn them about it.  However, as in my case, a conscience can be hardened by sin's deceitfulness (Hebrews 3:12:13) so that the person has no idea (or doesn't care about it) that they are sinning.  Of course, there are those sins which we do when we don't know that they're sinful to begin with.  Those take searching and examining of Scripture to find out that they are sinful and then repent and change.  The best question to ask in every circumstance to judge sinful possibilities is:  ""Would Jesus wholeheartedly do this at this point in time?""

How does one tell if a Second Coming is the real thing, unless the > person claiming to be IT is obviously insane?  First by his fruits.  The messiah comes to build the kingdom of heaven on the earth.  He also comes to first reveal the root cause of original sin (fallen nature) and then provide a means to cut the connection to that original sin.  He also wants to create world peace based on Godism.  The messiah's teachings will build on the foundation of the Bible but provide profound new insights into the nature of God, the fall of man, the purpose of creation, and God's providence of restoration.  It will also provide a foundation for the unity of all the World's religions.  Many Christians expect Jesus to come on literal clouds, so they may miss him when he returns. Just as the Jewish people missed Jesus 2000 years ago.  They are still waiting for his first coming.  The Jewish people of that age expected Elijah to come first.  Jesus said that John the Baptist was Elijah. But John the Baptist denied that he was Elijah.  (How did this reflect on Jesus?)  Later in prison John even questioned who Jesus was: ""is he the one who is to come or do we look for another"".

Very good point and perhaps the most important point of all for Christians: How to recognize the Second Coming?  The Messiah should not claim to be God.  What sets a Messiah apart is that he is born without original sin.  He is not born perfect but achieves perfection after a period of growth.  Adam and Eve were born sinless but they fell, and this tragedy meant that it would take God thousands of years to create the kingdom of heaven on the earth as God originally intended.  God's restoration providence is still not complete.  The messiah is the true Son of God, one with God, God's representative on the earth, but not God himself.  There is only one God.  > [Mark 13:21   And then if any one says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' > or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. ... > Mark 13:26   And then they will see the Son of man coming in clouds with > great power and glory.  > My understanding of Jesus' answer is that, unlike his first coming, > which was veiled, the second coming will be quite unmistakeable.  > By the way, from Koresh's public statement it's not so clear to me > that he is claiming to be Christ.

I don't find anywhere that God restricts heaven to particular ethnic groups or religious denominations or any other category that we humans like to drop people into. But He does REQUIRE that we believe and trust Him. In Hebrews it says that God spoke of old by the prophets (the old testament), but in these last days he has spoken to us by His son Jesus Christ. And we learn of Him through the pages of the New Testament. The Bible tells us what we need to believe. For those who have never heard, I leave them in God's capable care, He will make himself known as he desires. It behooves each one of us to act upon the knowledge we have. If you reject the claims of Jesus, and still go to heaven, then the joke's on me. If you reject him and go to hell, that's no joke, but it will be final.

I spoke to the pastor of my parish (Catholic) recently, by coincidence, on this subject.  His explaination was that while it is possible for a couple to marry without the presence of a priest, it is important to have it recognized by the Church as soon as it is possible.  Because the Church recoginizes itself as a community of believers, members of the church, to some degree, are to be held accountable to each other.  To be less hypothetical than that mythical couple on the desert island, there are many places in the world that do not have priests availible for marriages on a regular basis.  Therefore, couples get married without the priest being present, but get the priest to testify to their marriage when one comes through the area.  I remember a religion teacher in high school saying that the marriage ceremony is not for the benefit of the couple as much as it is for the benefit of the community.  Thus, married couples have some responsibility to the community to stay married, as divorce sets a bad example for the community.  Also, the couple has vowed to become one with one another--the community should be able to rely on that couple to be as one.  While couples may marry without witnesses, they may NOT get anulments without a priest present.  An anulment is simply an admission of the church that what they had declared a marriage was not, in fact, a marriage at all, for whatever reason.  So don't start getting married in the back seat of a station wagon and giving yourselves anulments a half-hour later!!  I tend to agree with the response back there that said couples become married as soon as they consumate their marriage, but I would add that couples should consider their marriage consumated if they have sex, whether or not they intended to be married, assuming they were both willing partners to the sexual act.  The couple must be prepared to raise any children they may have as a result of that sexual act with the benefit of both parents.  Sex IS a commitment, I believe, in God's eyes.  But I'm digressing....  God be with you,  Malcusco

Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20 Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters.   CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997. After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere, rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.  One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.  The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true nature of Saturn's rings.

Operations will start 11/93 for one martian year (687 days).   TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched 8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global observations of the sea level for several years, substantially increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.   ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.  Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!

The Catholic church? > Hate to step on toes. > thanks  An interesting interpretation of Revelation 17 and 18 has been given by evangelist David Wilkerson.  I am not saying that I totally agree with his interpretation, but it is certainly believable and good food for thought.  He interprets the Babylon of Revelation 17-18 as being none other than the good old U. S. of A.  That's right, America.  He supports his claim in several ways. The Babylon of Revelation is THE world leader in trade and commerce, and the WHOLE WORLD wept when Babylon fell.  The American dollar, despite the Japanese success of the 20th century, is STILL the most sought after currency in the world.  If the U.S. were destroyed, wouldn't the whole world mourn?  The bible also talks about Babylon being a home of harlots, sin, and adultery (I am paraphrasing, of course).  Babylon's sin affected, or should I say, infected, the whole world.  It doesn't take much looking to see that the U.S. is in a state of moral decay.  Hasn't the American culture and Hollywood spread the ""do it if it feels good"" mentality all over the world.  I think, though, that what Mr. Wilkerson uses as his strongest argument is the fact that Revelation calls Babylon ""Babylon the Great"" and portrays it as the most powerful nation on earth.  No matter how dissatisfied you are with the state of our country, I don't think you would have too much trouble agreeing that the U.S. is STILL the most powerful nation on earth.  Again, this interpretation is not NECESSARILY my own, but I do find it worthy of consideration.  Jeffrey Little "

As far as we can tell, man falls into the ""mammal"" catagory.  Now, if there were something more to the man (say, a soul), then we have yet to find evidence of such.  But as it is now, man is a mammal (babies are born live, mother gives milk, we're warm-blooded, etc.) as other mammals are and is similar in genetic construction to some of them (in particular, primates).

Random Misconfigured Site Lines: 42   A ""new Christian"" wrote that he was new to the faith and learning about it ""by reading the Bible, of course"". I am not at all sure this is the best path to follow. While the Bible is, for Christians, the word of God, the revelation of God is Jesus Christ and the chief legacy of this revalation is the Church. I am not recommending any one denommination, but I do recommend finding a comfortable christian congregation in which to develop your faith, rather than just reading the Bible. This does not mean that the Bible should not be read, although I would stick to the Gospels, epistles, and Psalms and avoid the Book of Revelation altogether [until you are with friends you are comfortable with]. I am sure that mistakenly fervent  projects to read the entire Bible have frequently bogged down with a remarkable lack of fervour somewhere in the middle of Leviticus, or for the really sturdy, somewhere in Chronicles. The point is that the Bible is their to illustrate the Faith of Christians, but does not provide the totality of that faith. Vital beliefs of virtually all Christians are simply not mentioned - the Trinity, the duality of natures in Christ, types of Church organization. All these beliefs and practices have developed from the lived experience of the Christian people, an experience lived one hopes in the Spirit. As such the Bible, I think, is better studies in the context of a congregation, and the context of other reading. Following up on a suggestion of an old confessor of mine, I would even suggest that a good novel is a good way to reflect on the christian life. [Most novels of any profundity are actually discussing the nature of good and evil in the human heart]. My own induction into the christian faith was brought about [after grace] through reading Graham Greene: _The Power and the Glory_ and the poetry of Gerard Manley Hopkins. I would also recommend Graham Greene's _Monsignor Quixote_ and any novel by Iris Murdoch. The last is not even a Christian, but such is her insistence on the need for the good life, that, frankly, I often am more uplifted and God directed after reading her than after reading many parts of the Bible. And that after all is what being a Christian is all about: letting your soul and your life be, in some way, directed towards the infinite, represented to us by the person of Jesus Christ.

We have biblical accounts of both his mother's ancestry and his father's, both tracing back to David.  It seems reasonable to assume, therefore, that Jesus was Semitic. As an interesting aside, Jesus' being semitic makes him neither ""white"" nor ""black,"" and in some sense underscores the point made earlier that his color was not important, it was his message, his grace, and his divinity that we should concentrate on. Finally, I would direct anyone interested in African involvement in the church to the account of the conversion of the Ethiopian eunuch in Acts chapter 9 (I think it's chapter 9).  This is one of the earliest conversions, and the eunuch, treasurer to the queen of the Ethiopians, was definitely African.

Here in America people tend to think of choosing a church much like they think of choosing a car or a country club. What I mean is that our culture is such that we tend towards satisfying our own wants rather than considering things with others in mind and not making prayer an initial and primary part of the decision process. People tend to treat church as they would a club and when something is less than to their liking, off they go to another one.  I think that scripture presents the idea that God takes a different perspective on the ""church choosing process"". It seems to me from 1Cor 12 that God doesn't subscribe to the idea of us choosing a church at all but that he places us in the body as he wants us. So, I think a better question is not how do I choose a church but how do I figure out where God is trying to place me.  If a person was instrumental in leading you to Christ, the church they go to is a logical first choice. You have been born into the family of God. People should hop around from church to church as often as they hop from natural family to family.  If you met the Lord on your own (so to speak) there may not be an easily identifiable church to try for starters. Here you are more like an orphan. Prayerfully go and ""leave yourself on a few doorsteps"" and see if anyplace feels like home.  I wouldn't expect that God want to place you in a church where you have difficulty fitting in with the people, but on the other hand there are no perfect churches. If you have an attitude of looking for problems you will both find them and make them. On the other hand if you have an attitude of love and committment, you will spread that wherever you go.  In general, I think that God will try to place you in a church that talks about the Lord in the way that you have come to know him and is expanding on that base. -- Peter White disclaimer: None of what is written necessarily reflects a view of my company.

You also have to take into consideration >whether the commands are good or bad.  You ask where we are.  I would echo that question.  I'm not trying to be contentious.  But assuming that the Pope has universal jurisdiction and authority, what authority do you rely upon for your decisions? What prevents me from choosing ANY doctrine I like and saying that Papal disagreement is an error that will be resolved in time? This is especially true, since Councils of Bishops have basically stood by the Pope.  It appears that much of what lies at the heart of this matter is disagreements over what is tradition and Tradition, and also over authority and discipline.  My question to the supporters of SSPX is this:  Is there ANY way that your positions with respect to church reforms could change and be conformed to those of the Pope? (assuming that the Pope's position does not change and that the leaders of SSPX don't jointly make such  choice.)  If not, this appears to be claiming infallible teaching authority. If I adopt the view that ""I'm NOT wrong, I CAN'T be wrong, and there's NO WAY I'll change my mind, YOU must change yours"", that I've either left the Catholic Church or it has left me.  The Orthodox Church does not recognize papal authority/jurisdiction viewing authority as present in each bishop, and in Ecumenical Councils.  We regard the subsequent development of the doctrines regarding papal authority and jurisdiction to be a separation of the Bishop of Rome from the Orthodox church.  Without going into the merits of the Great Schism, at least the Orthodox agree that a split occurred, and don't paly what appear to be semantic games like ""He's the Pope, but we don't recognize that what he does is effective..."".  Words aside, it appears to be a de facto split.  >So where are we?  Are we in another Arian heresy, complete with weak >Popes?  Or are the SSPX priests modern Martin Luthers?

I thought that the teaching magisterieum of the church did not allow error in teachings regarding faith and morals even in the short term.` I may be wrong here, I'm not Roman Catholic. :-)  What would be the effect of a Pope making an ex cathedra statement regarding the SSPX situation?  Would it be honored?  If not, how do you get around the formal doctrine of infallibility? Again, I'm not trying to be contentions, I'm trying to understand. Since I'm Orthodox, I've got no real vested interest in the outcome, one way or the other.  >Schism is a superset of disobedience (refusal to obey a legitimate >command).

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market. Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources (for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before uranium reached $200/lb.  ""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense.  Supply and demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century? Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate.  Uranium from seawater is interesting, but it's a long term project, or a project that the Japanese might justify on grounds of self-sufficiency.  Paul F. Dietz dietz@cs.rochester.edu "

However this does not mean that it's impossible for it to take wrong turns at one time or another.  The more specific concept of papal infallibility is that in very specific circumstances a papal statement can be known to be infallible.  However a relatively small fraction of statements meet those criteria.  This does not absolve Catholics from the duty to obey even ""ordinary"" teachings of the pope.

This implies that staying the same is a sin. A Christian should never be satisfied. It does not imply that having fun is a sin. It does not imply that sleeping is a sin.

The training course will discuss the applications of satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy and the environment.  The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing, selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1 data.  The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991 with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year 2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the potential of experts using the practical applications of radar remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near- coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.  The education and practical training programme was developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and information documents for the training course, will be provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will include high-level experts from other European and African organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for the training course are being provided by the United Nations    Trust Fund for New and Renewable Sources of Energy; the primary contributor to that Fund is the Government of Italy.  A similar training course is being planned for Latin American experts.

Let me carry that a step further.  Most doctors would not claim to be infallible.  Indeed, they would generally admit that they could conceivably be wrong, e.g. that in this case, a blood tranfusion might not turn out to be necessary after all.  However, the doctors would have enough confidence and conviction to claim, out of genuine concern, that is IS necessary.  As fallible human beings, they must acknowledge the possibility that they are wrong.  However, they would also say that such doubts are not reasonable, and stand by their convictions.  -- Virgilio ""Dean"" Velasco Jr, Department of Electrical Eng'g and Applied Physics CWRU graduate student, roboticist-in-training and Q wannabee ""Bullwinkle, that man's intimidating a referee!""   |    My boss is a ""Not very well.

The analogy does not depend on the premisses being true, because the question under discussion is not truth but arrogance.  A similar analogy might be a medical doctor who believes that a blood transfusion is necessary to save the life of a child whose parents are Jehovah's Witnesses and so have conscientious objections to blood transfusion.

One must approach the Qur'an with intelligence.  Any thinking approach to the Qur'an cannot but interpret the above verse and others like it that women and men are spiritual equals.  I think that the above verse does clearly imply that women have souls.  Does it make any sense for something without a soul to be forgiven?  Or to have a great reward (understood to be in the after-life)?  I think the usual answer would be no -- in which case, the part saying ""For them has God prepared forgiveness and a great reward"" says they have souls.  (If it makes sense to say that things without souls can be forgiven, then I have no idea _what_ a soul is.)  As for your saying that the quote above may not be given a high priority in all interpretations, any thinking approach to the Qur'an has to give all verses of the Qur'an equal priority.  That is because, according to Muslim belief, the _whole_ Qur'an is the revelation of God -- in fact, denying the truth of any part of the Qur'an is sufficient to be considered a disbeliever in Islam.  >Quite similar to you other post, even when the Quran does not encourage >slavery, it is not justified to say that iit forbids or puts an end to >slavery. It is a non sequitur.  Look, any approach to the Qur'an must be done with intelligence and thought.  It is in this fashion that one can try to understand the Quran's message.  In a book of finite length, it cannot explicitly answer every question you want to put to it, but through its teachings it can guide you.  I think, however, that women are the spiritual equals of men is clearly and unambiguously implied in the above verse, and that since women can clearly be ""forgiven"" and ""rewarded"" they _must_ have souls (from the above verse).  Let's try to understand what the Qur'an is trying to teach, rather than try to see how many ways it can be misinterpreted by ignoring this passage or that passage.  The misinterpretations of the Qur'an based on ignoring this verse or that verse are infinite, but the interpretations fully consistent are more limited.  Let's try to discuss these interpretations consistent with the text rather than how people can ignore this bit or that bit, for that is just showing how people can try to twist Islam for their own ends -- something I do not deny -- but provides no reflection on the true teachings of Islam whatsoever.

soc.religion.christian	 From: brownli@ohsu.edu@ohsu.edu (Liane Brown) Subject: DOCTRINE OF GOD Organization: Oregon Health Sciences University Lines: 111  This is being posted as a general outline for your personal study of this doctrine:   THE DOCTRINE OF GOD   I.   THE PERSONS OF THE GODHEAD Of all of the doctrines of Scripture, this is the most important.  The Bible is pre-eminently a revelation of God. Therefore, our first objective in studying the Bible should be to know God. I believe that the Bible teaches that there are Three Persons in the Godhead (Trinity):  God, the Father; God the Son--the Lord Jesus Christ; and God, the Holy Spirit.  I believe that they are individual Persons who are one in nature, meaning that They are identical in nature, each possessing the same divine attributes.  They are also equally worthy of our worship, our trust, and our obedience. Cf. Matt.28:19, 2 Cor.13:14; John 14:8,9,16,17.  II.  THE ATTRIBUTES, or CHARACTERISTICS, OF THE GODHEAD. A.  God's nature is revealed in the Name He has taken for Himself: Jehovah.  He is the living God, eternal, and unchanging.  He is without beginning, and without ending.  Cf. Isa.42:8. B.  God is a spirit.  Cf. John 4:24. C.  God is love.  Cf. 1 John 4:8,16. As such, He is gracious, merciful, good, faithful, patient, and full of lovingkindness.  Cf. Psa 89:1,2; Psa 103:8; Nahum 1:7. D.  But God is also holy and righteous.  He is absolutely without sin in His nature, and so is incapable of sinning in though, word, or action.  Cf. Ex. 15:11; Isa. 6:3. E.  God is omnipresent (everywhere present at the same time in the completeness of His Person), omniscient (all knowing, knowing all things--the end from the beginning, infinitely wise), omnipotent (almighty, sovereign, with unlimited power over all creation). God is infinite in His presence, wisdom, and power.  It is my conviction that the work of the Lord in our day has become very man-centered, and that the people in our churches know very little about God.  I believe that the Lord's work needs to be God-centered, and that the people of God need to understand that God is sovereign in all things:  in the affairs of nations, in the lives of all people, and in the carrying out of His purposes regarding salvation.  III.     THE WORKS OF THE GODHEAD. A.  In creation All Three Persons of the Godhead were active in creating, and all Three are active in sustaining creation, and in ordering the course of human affairs (for nations as well as individual people) to the end of time.  Cf. Gen. 1:1,2; John 1:1-3; Col. 1:16-17; Heb. 1:3. B.  In salvation In order to understand salvation I believe that it is absolutely necessary to begin with God, not with man. All three Persons of the Godhead have been, and are, active in salvation. 1.  God, the Father Salvation originated with God.  The Members of the Godhead determined in eternity past that there would be salvation, the conditions under which people could and would be saved, and even who would be saved.  Election to salvation is recognized in Scripture as the work of  God, the Father.  Cf. Eph 1:3-4; 2 Thess 2:13-14. 2.  Christ, the Son of God The Lord Jesus Christ, through His birth by the virgin Mary, came to the earth to accomplish two important works: a.   He came as the final and complete revelation of God, the Father.  Cf. Col 1:15; heb 1:1-3. b.   He came to provide salvation for all whom the Father had chosen.  He did this by His death on the Cross, by His bodily resurrection, and by His present intercessory work in heaven.  The work of salvation will be completed for us when the Lord returns.  Cf. Rom 5:8-10; 1 Cor 15:3- 4; Heb 7:25, 1 John 3:2. 3.  The Holy Spirit As the Author of Scripture, the theme of which is Christ and His redemptive work, the Holy Spirit is carrying out the redemptive plan of God in the following ways: a.   He convicts of sin. Cf. John 16:7-11 b.   He regenerates (known in the Bible as the new birth).  Cf. John 3:5-8. c.   He indwells each believer to fulfill the work of sanctification.  Cf. John 14-16-17. d.   He seals every believer in Christ, thus making salvation secure.  Cf. Eph 1:13-14. e.   He baptizes every believer into the body of Christ.  Cf. Cor. 12:13 f.   He teaches every believer the truth of Scripture. Cf. John 14:26. g.   He bestows spiritual gifts on the people of God for ministry.  (Cf. 1 Cor 12 h.   He restrains sin.  Cf Gal 5:16-26. i.   He empowers for living and for service. Cf. Acts 1:8   ---------------------------------- Liane Brown (Internet) brownli@ohsu.edu Portland Oregon

Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?  This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported etc.  See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of software process maturity are:  1. Initial 2. Repeatable 3. Defined 4. Managed 5. Optimizing  The levels are approximately characterized as follows:  1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will be.  Most software production is at this level.  2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects are planned in detail, and there is software configuration management and quality assurance.  3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management, and typically a `software engineering process group' within the project.  4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this information. Software quality is measured and has goals.  5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts are effective and certified.  Nick Haines nickh@cmu.edu

If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo, but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than just a ""we have the money, why not?"" approach.  Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European cooperation.  Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at the size of that multiplier :->).

The White House thinks expectations for Russian cooperation have been raised too high.  The article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly impossible.  That's why some think Goldin has begun looking at Russian hardware.  Goldin states NASA will present all options to the administration which will then have decision making power.

Simon P. Worden, The Deputy for Technology, SDIO  Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach April 3,1993  Most of you, as am I, are ""children of the 1960's.""  We grew up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles, nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were miracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits have told us - ""you've lost it!""  The ""me"" generation is only living on the accomplishments of the past.  You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle - to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.  What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen. Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and Poseidon ballistic missiles.  Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened to your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated into today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.  You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who started this program for the SDI.  Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they moved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more before putting the first ""rubber on the road.""  Max Hunter - you didn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable aerospace transportation is real.  We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us - launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored the importance of our work in bringing about a new international relationship.  But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.  We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And yes - we'll make a little money off it too!  Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!  To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to the final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn V's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at hand!  This project is real.  The torch of American technological greatness is being passed.  We are Americans.  This machine is American.  Let's go fly it! "

I think it's safe to say that Hell was never intended metaphorical. Certainly not the equivalent of ceasing to exist. Some christian concepts are indeed metaphors, but your idea of Hell is a 20th century interpretation. It is, of course, nice to see that even christianity might evolve to fit the worldview of modern age, but I fear the church will not accept it.

If you're prepared to say ""Let's round these people up and stick them in a concentration camp without trial"", it's only a short step to gassing them without trial.  After all, it seems that the Nazis originally only intended to imprison the Jews; the Final Solution was dreamt up partly because they couldn't afford to run the camps because of the devastation caused by Goering's Total War.
